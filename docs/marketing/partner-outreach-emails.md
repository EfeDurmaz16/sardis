## New Partner Outreach

### 1. Coinbase Onramp - Partnership Request

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Sardis x Coinbase Onramp for AI Agent Payments

**To:** Developer Platform partnerships / BD team (via https://coinbase.com/developer-platform)

---

Hi Coinbase Onramp team,

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis (sardis.sh) - the Payment OS for the Agent Economy. We provide non-custodial infrastructure enabling AI agents to make real financial transactions with natural language spending policies.

We're building fiat on/off-ramp capabilities for our agent wallets and Coinbase Onramp is our top choice for USDC funding:

- **Use case:** AI agents need to convert fiat to USDC to fund their Turnkey MPC wallets for autonomous payments
- **Volume:** Starting with developer sandbox, scaling to production with our design partners
- **Chain focus:** Base (primary), Polygon, Ethereum
- **Why Coinbase:** 0% fee for USDC, Base-native, most trusted brand for our enterprise customers

Our SDK is live on PyPI (4,600/mo installs) and npm (2,190/mo installs) across 25 packages. We have an MCP server with 65+ tools integrated into Claude, Cursor, and other AI platforms.

Would love to explore a partnership. Happy to share a demo or technical architecture overview.

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz

### 2. Transak - Partner Onboarding

**Subject:** Partner Application: Sardis - AI Agent Payment Infrastructure

**To:** Partner onboarding team (via https://transak.com "Become a Partner")

---

Hi Transak team,

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis (sardis.sh). We're building payment infrastructure for the AI agent economy - non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies.

We're looking for a fast-onboarding fiat ramp partner and Transak stands out:

- **Need:** Fiat-to-USDC/EURC on-ramp for AI agent wallets
- **Markets:** US initially, expanding to EU (EURC support is important)
- **Integration:** REST API into our existing wallet infrastructure (Turnkey MPC)
- **Timeline:** Looking to integrate within 1-2 weeks for developer sandbox

Our platform is open-source with 25 published packages, 6,800+ monthly installs, and integrations with every major AI framework (LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude).

Would love to start the partner onboarding process. Happy to provide any technical details needed.

Best,

### 3. Stripe Issuing - Setup Request

**Subject:** Stripe Issuing for AI Agent Virtual Cards - Sardis

**To:** Stripe dashboard signup or Sales

---

Hi Stripe team,

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis (sardis.sh). We're building the Payment OS for the Agent Economy - infrastructure that gives AI agents programmable wallets with spending controls.

We'd like to set up Stripe Issuing for per-agent virtual cards:

- **Model:** Platform-level Stripe Treasury (1 account) with per-agent virtual cards via Stripe Issuing
- **Use case:** Each AI agent gets its own Visa card with individual spending limits, merchant restrictions, and real-time monitoring
- **Architecture:** Non-custodial - we orchestrate, Stripe holds funds under its license
- **Features we need:** Virtual card creation, real-time authorizations, spending controls, webhook notifications

We already have Stripe Issuing provider code in our SDK and are ready to integrate with production keys. Our sub-ledger tracks per-agent balances against the platform Treasury.

Could we schedule a call to discuss setup and compliance requirements?

Efe Baran Durmaz

## Follow-Up Templates

### 4. Bridge - Follow-Up (Production Key)

**Subject:** Follow-up: Sardis Production API Key Request

---

Hi Bridge team,

Following up on my earlier request for production API keys. We've completed our sandbox integration and are ready to go live.

Quick update on our progress:
- 25 packages published (PyPI + npm), 6,800+ monthly installs
- 65+ MCP tools for Claude/Cursor integration
- Landing page live at sardis.sh
- Design partner pipeline growing

Our Bridge integration code is complete and tested in sandbox. We just need production keys to start processing real transactions for our early design partners.

Would appreciate an update on the timeline for production access.

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis

### 5. Lithic - Follow-Up (Production Key)

**Subject:** Follow-up: Sardis x Lithic Production Access

---

Hi Lithic team,

Following up on our production API key request. Our sandbox integration is complete and tested.

Since my last email, we've also built Stripe Issuing as an alternative card provider, giving our customers a choice. However, Lithic remains our preferred option for its developer-first API and velocity controls.

Ready to move to production whenever keys are available.

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis

### 6. Persona - Follow-Up (Production Key)

**Subject:** Follow-up: Sardis KYC Integration - Production Access

---

Hi Persona team,

Following up on production API access for our KYC integration. Our Persona integration is fully built and tested in sandbox mode.

We use Persona for "Know Your Agent" (KYA) - verifying the identity of the human operators behind AI agents before they can make financial transactions. This is a compliance-critical part of our pipeline.

Could you provide an update on production key availability?

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis

### 7. Elliptic - Follow-Up (Production Key)

**Subject:** Follow-up: Sardis Sanctions Screening - Production Access

---

Hi Elliptic team,

Following up on our production API key request for sanctions/AML screening.

Our Elliptic integration is complete in our compliance pipeline:
Rules -> KYA -> Sanctions (Elliptic) -> KYC (Persona) -> Audit

Every agent transaction goes through sanctions screening before execution. We need production keys to start processing real transactions for our design partners.

Would appreciate an update on access.

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis

## Backup Partners (if no response in 2 weeks)

### 8. Veriff - Self-Serve KYC (Persona backup)

**Subject:** Sardis - AI Agent KYC with Veriff Self-Serve

**To:** Self-serve signup at https://veriff.com/plans/self-serve

---

Hi Veriff team,

I'm interested in the $49/mo self-serve plan for KYC verification in our AI agent payment platform, Sardis (sardis.sh).

We verify the identity of humans operating AI agents ("Know Your Agent") before allowing financial transactions. Need:
- ID document verification
- Selfie matching
- API integration (REST)
- Fast verification (<10 seconds ideal)

Starting with low volume (~50 verifications/month), scaling with design partners.

Best,
Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis

**Subject:** Sardis - Sanctions Screening API Integration

**To:** Sales/Partnership at https://scorechain.com

Interested in your free sanctions API for:
- OFAC/EU/UN sanctions list screening
- Real-time transaction screening before execution
- Wallet address screening on Base, Polygon, Ethereum

Would like to start with the free tier and scale to paid as volume grows.

Best,
