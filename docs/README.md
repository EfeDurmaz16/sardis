## 🚨 IMPORTANT: V2 Strategic Shift

**Sardis has been repositioned from a marketplace to an execution layer.**

### The Change

**V1 (Old):** "Stripe for AI Agents" - E-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart, merchant features

**V2 (New):** "Stablecoin Execution Layer for AP2/TAP" - Payment execution & settlement infrastructure

### Why This Matters

Google, PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and 80+ companies launched **AP2 (Agentic Payments Protocol v2)** in December 2024. AP2 defines intent, mandate, and authorization layers but **lacks a stablecoin execution engine**.

**Sardis V2 fills this gap** by providing:
- Mandate enforcement (AP2-compliant)
- Cryptographic identity (TAP-compliant)
- Multi-chain settlement
- MPC custody
- Compliance stack (KYC/AML)

**Result:** Focused, defensible, protocol-aligned product strategy.
