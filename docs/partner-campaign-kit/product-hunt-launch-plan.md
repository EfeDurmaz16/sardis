# Sardis - Payment OS for the Agent Economy

AI agents are transforming how we work. They can research, code, and manage complex tasks. But there's one thing they still can't do safely: **spend money**.

## The Problem

When you give an agent payment access today, you're choosing between:
- Full access (dangerous - agents make mistakes)

### Response Templates

**Praise Response:**
```
Thank you so much for the kind words! We've been building this for [X months]
and it means a lot to see it resonate.

Curious - what's your primary use case? Are you looking to give agents
payment access for personal automation or building something for users?
```

**Question Response (Framework):**
```
Great question about [topic]!

[Direct, specific answer - 1-2 sentences]

[Additional context if helpful]

Let me know if you'd like me to dive deeper on any aspect.
Happy to share code examples too!
```

**Technical Question Response:**
```
[Direct answer]

Here's how it works:

[Code snippet or technical explanation]

We have more detailed docs at sardis.sh/docs/[relevant-section]
if you want to dig deeper. Also happy to jump on a quick call
if you're evaluating for a specific project.
```

**Criticism Response:**
```
Really appreciate you raising this - it's a fair concern.

Here's how we think about it: [honest explanation]

[What we're doing to address it, if applicable]

Would love to hear more about your specific use case -
that helps us prioritize the right solutions.
```

**Comparison Response (e.g., "How is this different from just using Stripe?"):**
```
Great question! Stripe is fantastic for human-initiated payments.

The difference with Sardis:

1. **Policy layer**: Stripe executes what you tell it.
   Sardis enforces rules on WHAT can be executed
   (e.g., "max $50/day, only these vendors")

2. **Non-custodial**: Agent controls keys via MPC.
   You set rules, not direct card access.

3. **Agent-native**: Built for LangChain, Claude MCP, etc.
   Not retrofitting human payment flows.

Think of it as: Stripe is the road. Sardis is the guardrails
that keep the AI driver from going off-course.
```

**Feature Request Response:**
```
Love this idea! [Genuine reaction]

It's actually on our radar - [share roadmap context if true].

Right now our priority is [current focus], but feedback like this
helps us sequence the roadmap. Would you be interested in being
a design partner when we build this?
```

**Bug/Issue Response (CRITICAL - Respond in < 15 min):**
```
Thanks for flagging this - investigating now!

Could you share [specific info needed: error message, browser,
steps to reproduce]?

I'll update this thread as soon as we have more info.
Really appreciate your patience.

[Follow up within 1 hour with status update]
```

### Upvote Driving Strategy

**Do:**
- Email your existing waitlist/users with personal message
- Post on Twitter/X with genuine excitement
- Share in relevant Discord/Slack communities (where appropriate)
- Reach out to supporters 1:1 via DM
- Engage authentically in every comment

**Don't:**
- Ask for upvotes explicitly on Product Hunt
- Use upvote exchange groups
- Create fake accounts
- Spam communities with links
- Offer incentives for upvotes

### Community Outreach (Coordinated for Launch Day)

## 4. Maker Comments & Templates

### First Comment (Post Immediately at Launch)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], founder of Sardis.

This started from a personal disaster: I gave my Claude assistant access
to buy API credits, and it "optimized" by purchasing a $500 enterprise
plan I didn't need.

That's when I realized: **agents don't understand money the way humans do.**
They need guardrails.

Sardis is those guardrails. You set the rules in plain English,
agents follow them, everyone's happy.

**A few things I'm proud of:**
- Zero-config MCP server for Claude Desktop
- Policies in actual English (not YAML/JSON configs)
- Full audit trail for every transaction
- Multi-chain crypto + instant virtual cards
- Open source SDKs

**What we're working on next:**
- More framework integrations
- Team/enterprise policy management
- Expanded merchant support

**Would love your feedback on:**
1. What policies would you want for your agents?
2. Which integrations should we prioritize?
3. Any edge cases we should handle?

We're here all day - AMA!
```

### Update Comment Schedule

**Hour 2 Update:**
```markdown
**Quick update at Hour 2**

Wow - thank you for the incredible reception! Already seeing some
great questions in the comments.

A few patterns I'm noticing:
- Many of you are using Claude Desktop / Cursor - the MCP server
  is ready to go: `npm install @sardis/mcp-server`
- Lots of interest in enterprise/team features - that's next on our roadmap
- Questions about pricing - the free tier (100 tx/month) is permanent,
  not a trial

Keep the questions coming!
```

**Hour 8 Update (Feature Spotlight):**
```markdown
**Hour 8 Update - Deep Dive: Natural Language Policies**

Since this is our most-asked-about feature, let me explain how it works:

Instead of writing JSON config like:
```json
{
  "max_daily_amount": 100,
  "allowed_categories": ["developer_tools"],
  "require_approval_above": 50
}
```

You just write:
```
Max $100/day on developer tools. Require my approval for anything over $50.
```

Under the hood, we parse this into structured policy rules using an LLM,
then evaluate every transaction against those rules deterministically.

Why does this matter?
- Non-technical founders can set policies
- Policies are readable and auditable
- Easy to update without code changes

Try it out at sardis.sh/playground (policy sandbox coming this week!)
```

**Hour 12 Update (Milestone):**
```markdown
**Halfway Update!**

We just hit [X upvotes] - thank you all!

Some stats from launch so far:
- [X] new signups
- [X] questions answered in comments
- [X] feature requests logged

Most requested integration so far: [Integration name] -
definitely moving that up the priority list!

Questions keep coming - we're reading and responding to every one.
```

**Hour 16 Update (Behind the Scenes):**
```markdown
**Hour 16 - Behind the Scenes**

Figured I'd share a bit about why we built this.

Before Sardis, I was building [previous project]. We tried giving our
AI agent access to AWS credits for auto-scaling. It worked great...
until we got a $2,000 bill because the agent decided "more is better."

That's when the lightbulb went off. The problem isn't that agents
are malicious - they're just not equipped to understand financial
consequences the way humans do.

We spent [X months] building the policy engine, got early access
to the AP2 protocol spec (huge thanks to the Google/PayPal/Visa team),
and now we're here.

Crazy to think how much AI will be spending in the next few years.
Someone needs to build the safety layer. We're trying to be that.
```

**Hour 20 Update (FAQ Roundup):**
```markdown
**Hour 20 - FAQ Roundup**

Compiling the most common questions from today:

**Q: Is this just for crypto payments?**
A: No! We support both crypto (USDC, USDT across multiple chains)
AND fiat via instant virtual cards (Lithic). Use whichever fits your use case.

**Q: What if my agent tries to bypass the policy?**
A: It can't. The wallet won't sign transactions that fail policy checks.
It's enforced at the infrastructure level, not the agent level.

**Q: How is this different from just setting API rate limits?**
A: Rate limits cap volume. Policies understand context.
"Only AWS for dev tools" can't be expressed as a rate limit.

**Q: Can I self-host?**
A: SDKs are open source. The MPC wallet infrastructure is managed
(via Turnkey), but we're exploring self-hosted options for enterprise.

**Q: What's the latency impact?**
A: Policy checks add ~50ms. Chain transactions are the bottleneck,
not us.

Keep them coming!
```

**Final Update (Hour 24):**
```markdown
**Final Update - Thank You!**

## Appendix D: Social Media Assets

### Twitter/X Thread (Coordinate with Launch)

```
1/ We just launched on @ProductHunt

AI agents can research, code, and manage tasks. But giving them your credit card? That's been... terrifying.

Until now.

Introducing Sardis - the financial firewall for AI agents.

[Link]

2/ The problem:

Your Claude assistant needs to buy API credits. You either:
- Give it your card (dangerous)
- Approve every $5 purchase (tedious)

There's no middle ground.

3/ Sardis fixes this.

You write policies in plain English:
"Max $50/day on dev tools. Require approval over $20."

Your agent gets a wallet. But every transaction passes through your rules first.

4/ Works with what you're already using:

- Claude Desktop/Cursor: MCP server
- LangChain: Python SDK
- Vercel AI SDK: TypeScript
- OpenAI: Native integration

One npm install. Zero config.

5/ Built on industry standards:

- AP2 (Google/PayPal/Visa/Mastercard)
- Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- Stablecoins + virtual cards for fiat
- Full audit trail

6/ We're live on Product Hunt today.

Would love your support - every upvote helps!

[Product Hunt link]

AI agents will handle $1T+ in transactions by 2027.

Sardis is how we make that safe.

sardis.sh
```

### LinkedIn Post (Founder Personal Account)

```
I'm excited to share that Sardis just launched on Product Hunt.

The problem we're solving: AI agents are getting powerful enough to handle
real tasks, but giving them access to money is still terrifying.

We built Sardis as a "financial firewall" - you set spending policies in
plain English, and agents can only transact within those boundaries.

After months of building, testing with early users, and integrating with
Claude, LangChain, and other frameworks, we're finally ready to show the world.

If you're interested in the intersection of AI and financial infrastructure,
I'd love your support on Product Hunt today:

[Link]

And if you have questions about how agents will handle money in the future,
I'm happy to chat.

Let's build the trust layer for the agent economy.
```
