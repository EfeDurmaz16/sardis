### Email 1: Revo Capital

**Subject:** Sardis — Turkish founder building the payment OS for AI agents

**Body:**

Merhaba Revo ekibi,

I'm Efe Baran Durmaz, solo founder building Sardis from Istanbul — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents.

MPC wallets (Turnkey), natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement (Base, Polygon, USDC), virtual cards (Lithic), KYC/AML built-in. MCP Server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

The agent economy is projected at $47B by 2030. Sardis is the infrastructure layer that lets AI agents spend money safely. No one else is combining non-custodial custody + natural language policies + MCP-native design.

Raising $1.5-2M pre-seed. Would love to discuss: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 2: 212 Ventures

**Subject:** Agent payment infra from Istanbul — Sardis

**Body:**

Merhaba 212 ekibi,

Efe Baran Durmaz, building Sardis from Istanbul. Non-custodial payment OS for AI agents — when AI agents need to move money, they need wallets, spending policies, and compliance. That's us.

MPC wallets, natural language limits ("max $500/day, only whitelisted vendors"), multi-chain USDC settlement, virtual cards via Lithic. 36-tool MCP Server for Claude Desktop integration.

Competitors (Skyfire $9.5M, Payman AI $13.8M) are custodial. We're non-custodial — neither Sardis nor the agent holds the full key. Fundamentally different security model.

$1.5-2M pre-seed. https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 3: 500 Global MENA

**Subject:** AI agent payments — pre-seed from Istanbul

**Body:**

Hi 500 Global MENA team,

Building Sardis — the payment OS for AI agents. When AI agents autonomously buy APIs, process refunds, or manage procurement, they need non-custodial wallets with spending guardrails.

MPC wallets, natural language policies, USDC settlement on Base/Polygon, virtual cards, KYC/AML. 36-tool MCP Server. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

The agent economy is the next fintech vertical. Sardis is the infrastructure layer that makes it safe.

### Email 4: Polychain Capital

**Subject:** Non-custodial agent wallets — Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Olaf,

Building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets via Turnkey, natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement (Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism), USDC-native.

The thesis: AI agents are the next class of economic actors. They need their own financial identity — wallets, policies, compliance — without custodial risk. Not retrofitted human payment rails.

Competitors are custodial (Skyfire, Payman AI). We're MPC-native: neither Sardis nor the agent holds the full key.

### Email 5: Electric Capital

**Subject:** Agent payment infrastructure — pre-seed

**Body:**

Hi Avichal,

Building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, whitelisted vendors"), USDC settlement on Base/Polygon, virtual cards via Lithic.

We built an MCP Server with 36 tools — Claude Desktop agents can create wallets, set policies, execute payments. Python + TypeScript SDKs for any framework.

Electric Capital's infrastructure thesis + your YC advisory role = I think this fits. Agent economy is the next infra wave.

### Email 6: Multicoin Capital

**Subject:** Agent payment protocol — MPC + spending policies

**Body:**

Hi Kyle,

Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Thesis: AI agents need their own financial primitive — wallets, spending policies, compliance. Not Stripe for bots.

Technical stack: MPC wallets (Turnkey), natural language policies (LLM-parsed, deterministic enforcement), multi-chain (Base, Polygon, ETH, Arb, OP), USDC settlement, virtual cards (Lithic), KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic).

What makes us different: non-custodial. Competitors hold custody. We use threshold signatures — no single party controls funds. Fundamental architectural choice.

### Email 7: CoinFund

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi Jake,

CoinFund has been backing infrastructure since 2015 — right time for the next primitive: agent payments.

Building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, USDC on Base/Polygon, virtual cards. MCP Server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop integration.

When an agent needs to buy an API, process a refund, or manage a budget — Sardis is the wallet + policy layer. Non-custodial, compliant, multi-chain.

$1.5-2M pre-seed. Would love to share more: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 8: Castle Island Ventures

**Subject:** Stablecoin payments for AI agents — Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Castle Island team,

Your thesis on stablecoin payments and institutional crypto infrastructure is exactly where Sardis sits.

Building the payment OS for AI agents — non-custodial MPC wallets with USDC-native settlement. When an AI agent processes a payment, Sardis checks natural language spending policies, executes on-chain, and logs the audit trail. All non-custodial.

Stablecoins + AI agents = the next payment rail. Not human wallets repurposed — agent-native from day one.

### Email 9: Shima Capital

**Subject:** Pre-seed: agent payment infra

**Body:**

Hi Yida,

Shima's speed at pre-seed Web3 is legendary — 360+ investments. Here's one more.

Sardis: non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, USDC settlement (Base, Polygon), virtual cards (Lithic), KYC/AML. MCP Server for Claude Desktop.

Why now: AI agents are going from "chat" to "transact." They need wallets, not API keys. Non-custodial, not custodial.

### Email 10: NFX

**Subject:** Agent payment OS — NFX FAST

**Body:**

Hi NFX team,

Submitting through FAST — but wanted to share context. Building Sardis: non-custodial payment OS for AI agents.

NFX ranks top for both AI and crypto pre-seed. Sardis sits exactly at the intersection: MPC wallets + natural language spending policies + multi-chain settlement for AI agents that need to transact.

36-tool MCP Server for Claude Desktop. Python + TypeScript SDKs. Non-custodial (vs. custodial competitors). USDC-native.

### Email 11: Craft Ventures (David Sacks)

**Subject:** PayPal for AI agents — non-custodial

**Body:**

Hi David,

You built PayPal for humans. Sardis is the payment OS for AI agents.

Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, only whitelisted vendors"), USDC settlement on Base/Polygon, virtual cards via Lithic. When an AI agent needs to make a payment, Sardis checks policy → executes → returns receipt. No human in the loop.

MCP Server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop. The AI x crypto x payments thesis in one product.

### Email 12: QED Investors

**Subject:** Agent-native payment infrastructure — pre-seed

**Body:**

Hi QED team,

QED's fintech infrastructure thesis meets the agent economy. AI agents are becoming economic actors — they need payment infrastructure designed for them, not retrofitted from human rails.

Building Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, USDC settlement, virtual cards, KYC/AML. 36-tool MCP Server. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

Competitors are custodial. Sardis is non-custodial — threshold signatures, no single point of key control. Different architecture, different security model.

**Subject:** Plaid for AI agents — Sardis

**Body:**

Hi William,

You built the financial connectivity layer for humans. The next version is for AI agents.

Sardis: non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, USDC settlement, virtual cards. When an agent needs to move money — create wallet, check policy, execute, receipt. API-first, SDK-native.

With 34+ fintech investments, you see the pattern. Agents are the next banking customer. They need infrastructure, not workarounds.

Building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain USDC settlement (Base, Polygon, ETH), virtual cards for fiat rails. Agent decides → Sardis checks policy → settles.

With 100+ angel investments, you understand infrastructure bets. Agents are the next payment user.

### Email 18: Clément Delangue (HuggingFace CEO)

**Subject:** Payment SDK for AI agents — Sardis

Hi Clément,

HuggingFace agents can reason, generate, and execute. One thing they can't do: spend money.
