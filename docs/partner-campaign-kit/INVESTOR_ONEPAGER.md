# Sardis - AI Agent Payment Infrastructure

## One-Liner
**Stripe for AI Agents** - Enabling autonomous software to transact safely while humans maintain control.

## The Problem
AI agents are going mainstream, but they can't safely handle money. No spending limits, no compliance, no human oversight.

## The Solution
**Sardis Payment OS** - Natural language policies that let businesses define how their AI agents spend:

```
"Allow payments up to $500. Require approval over $1000. Block gambling."
```
