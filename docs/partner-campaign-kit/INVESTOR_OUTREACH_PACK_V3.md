## 25 NEW Investor Targets + 20 Personalized Emails
### Positioning: Payment Infrastructure for AI Agents (Fiat + Crypto Rails)

**Prepared by:** Efe Baran Durmaz

**Stage:** Pre-seed, testnet only
**Ask:** $1.5-2M pre-seed
**Booking:** https://cal.com/sardis/30min

## POSITIONING NOTE

Sardis is a **payment infrastructure company**, not a crypto company. The product supports:
- **Virtual cards** (Lithic) — fully fiat, Visa/Mastercard rails
- **On-chain settlement** (USDC) — optional crypto rail for web3 use cases
- **MPC wallets** — security architecture for key management, not "crypto wallets"
- **Natural language spending policies** — the core innovation
- **Enterprise compliance** — KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic)

Most early customers will use the virtual card / fiat path. On-chain is an option, not a requirement.

## PERSONALIZED EMAILS (20)

### Messaging Framework (Fiat-First Positioning)

**Lead:** "AI agents are becoming economic actors. They need payment infrastructure."
**Product:** "Virtual cards (Lithic) + optional on-chain rails. Natural language spending policies. Enterprise compliance."
**Differentiation:** "Non-custodial key management. Policy-enforced autonomy. Agent-native, not human-rails-retrofitted."
**Ask:** "30-min call to discuss → cal.com/sardis/30min"

### Email 1: Nyca Partners

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure for AI agents — Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Nyca team,

AI agents are starting to transact — buying API credits, processing refunds, managing procurement. They need payment infrastructure designed for them.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Virtual cards via Lithic for fiat rails. Natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, only approved vendors"). MPC key management for secure custody. KYC/AML built-in. Optional stablecoin settlement for web3 use cases.

Think of it as Marqeta for AI agents — card issuing + spending policies, but agent-native.

### Email 2: Spark Capital

**Subject:** Plaid connected accounts. Sardis connects wallets to agents.

**Body:**

Hi Spark team,

You backed Plaid (financial data for apps) and Ramp (spend management for teams). Sardis is the next layer: spend management for AI agents.

Virtual cards via Lithic. Natural language spending policies. MPC key management. When an AI agent needs to buy something, Sardis checks the policy, issues a virtual card, executes, logs the receipt. Fully autonomous, fully auditable.

Optional on-chain settlement for crypto use cases, but most customers start with fiat/card rails.

### Email 3: Felicis Ventures

**Subject:** The Stripe for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Aydin,

Stripe made payments easy for developers. Sardis makes payments safe for AI agents.

When an agent processes a refund, buys API credits, or manages a budget — it needs a financial identity. Sardis: virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC custody, KYC/AML. Python + TypeScript SDKs. MCP Server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop.

Not crypto-first — fiat virtual cards are the primary rail. On-chain USDC settlement is an option for web3 customers.

### Email 4: Benchmark

**Subject:** Modern Treasury for agent payments

**Body:**

Hi Benchmark team,

You backed Modern Treasury ($2B) — payment operations for enterprises. The next frontier: payment operations for AI agents.

Building Sardis: when an AI agent needs to spend money, it gets a virtual card (Lithic), spending policies in plain English ("max $1K/day, only whitelisted vendors"), and full audit trail. MPC key management, KYC/AML compliance. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

Agents are the next class of economic actors. They need infra, not workarounds.

### Email 5: Commerce Ventures

**Subject:** Payment infra for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi Commerce Ventures team,

Your thesis: payment infrastructure for the next era of commerce. That era is agentic.

Building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Virtual cards (Lithic) for fiat purchases. Natural language spending policies. MPC key management for secure, non-custodial operation. Optional on-chain settlement for crypto-native customers.

When a customer service agent processes a refund, a procurement agent buys supplies, or a coding agent pays for API credits — Sardis is the payment layer.

### Email 6: Greylock

**Subject:** Financial infrastructure for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Sarah,

You've been investing at the intersection of AI and infrastructure. There's a gap: AI agents can reason, generate, and execute — but they can't spend money.

Building Sardis — the payment layer for AI agents. Virtual cards, natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, approved vendors only"), MPC key management, enterprise compliance. MCP Server with 36 tools, Python + TypeScript SDKs.

Not a crypto company — virtual cards (fiat) are the primary rail. On-chain is optional. The core innovation is natural language policies + agent-native custody.

### Email 7: SignalFire

**Subject:** The missing SDK for agent payments

**Body:**

Hi SignalFire team,

Your data-driven approach to infrastructure investments — here's a signal: AI agents are going from "chat" to "transact." They need payment SDKs, not Stripe API keys.

Sardis: virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, KYC/AML. Python + TypeScript SDKs. MCP Server for Claude Desktop with 36 payment tools.

Agent creates wallet → sets policy in plain English → spends via virtual card → receipt auto-logged. No human in the loop.

### Email 8: First Round Capital

**Subject:** Pre-seed: payment infra for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi First Round team,

AI agents are becoming economic actors — and they're using Stripe API keys and shared credit cards as a workaround. That's not infrastructure; it's a hack.

Building Sardis: virtual cards for each agent (Lithic), natural language spending policies, non-custodial key management, enterprise compliance. 36-tool MCP Server. SDKs for Python + TypeScript.

The thesis: every AI agent that transacts will need a financial identity. Sardis is that identity.

### Email 9: Initialized Capital

**Subject:** Agent payment infrastructure — YC-adjacent

**Body:**

Hi Initialized team,

With Garry at YC, you see what's coming: AI agents doing real work — including financial work. They need payment infrastructure that's agent-native.

Sardis: virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, KYC/AML. MCP Server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

Not crypto-first. Virtual cards are the primary rail. On-chain settlement is optional. Core value: agents spend money safely within policies.

### Email 10: Afore Capital

**Subject:** Seed-stage: agent-native payment infra

**Body:**

Hi Afore team,

Your seed-stage infra thesis — here's a new category: payment infrastructure for AI agents.

Sardis: virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, enterprise compliance. When an AI agent needs to buy something — API credit, SaaS subscription, vendor payment — Sardis is the payment layer.

36-tool MCP Server for Claude Desktop. Python + TypeScript SDKs. $1.5-2M pre-seed.

The market: every company deploying AI agents that transact needs this.

### Email 11: a16z (AI Infrastructure Fund)

**Subject:** Payment layer for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi a16z team,

You've been writing about the agent economy — agents that reason, plan, and act. One capability they're missing: spending money safely.

Building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Virtual cards (Lithic) for fiat. Optional USDC settlement for crypto. Natural language spending policies. MPC custody. KYC/AML. MCP Server with 36 tools.

The insight: human payment rails don't work for agents. Agents need their own financial identity with policy-enforced autonomy.

### Email 12: Seedcamp

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure for AI agents — pre-seed from Istanbul

**Body:**

Hi Seedcamp team,

You backed Wise (cross-border payments for humans). The next frontier: payment infrastructure for AI agents.

Building Sardis from Istanbul. Virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, enterprise compliance. Python + TypeScript SDKs. MCP Server for Claude Desktop.

When AI agents transact — buying, refunding, settling — they need infrastructure designed for autonomous operation. Not human payment rails retrofitted.

### Email 13: Notion Capital

**Subject:** EMEA B2B SaaS — agent payment infrastructure

**Body:**

Hi Notion Capital team,

AI agents are entering enterprise workflows across EMEA — and they're starting to transact. They need payment infrastructure.

Sardis: virtual cards for fiat payments (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, KYC/AML. When a procurement agent buys supplies or a CS agent processes a refund, Sardis enforces the policy and executes.

Building from Istanbul with global ambition. $1.5-2M pre-seed.

### Email 14: Visa Ventures

**Subject:** AI agents as the next Visa cardholder

**Body:**

Hi Visa Ventures team,

AI agents are becoming the next class of cardholders. Sardis is making that happen.

We issue virtual Visa cards (via Lithic) to AI agents with natural language spending policies. Agent decides to buy → Sardis checks policy → issues one-time virtual card → transaction executes on Visa rails → receipt logged.

Enterprise compliance: KYC, AML, audit trail. The volume play: billions of AI agents × frequent micro-transactions = significant payment volume on Visa rails.

### Email 15: Mastercard Start Path

**Subject:** Sardis — Start Path application (AI agent payments)

**Body:**

Hi Mastercard Start Path team,

Applying to Start Path with Sardis — payment OS for AI agents.

We issue virtual cards to AI agents with natural language spending policies. Agent needs to buy → policy check → virtual card issued → Mastercard rails → receipt. Enterprise-grade: KYC, AML, audit trail.

The opportunity: as AI agents proliferate, they'll generate billions of card transactions. Sardis is the infrastructure layer that makes agents legitimate cardholders.

### Email 16: Salesforce Ventures

**Subject:** Agent payments for enterprise CRM workflows

**Body:**

Hi Salesforce Ventures team,

Agentforce is making AI agents first-class citizens in enterprise workflows. When those agents handle customer requests involving money — refunds, billing adjustments, payment collection — they need a payment layer.

Sardis: virtual cards, natural language spending policies, MPC key management, enterprise compliance. One SDK integration → Salesforce agents can execute financial transactions within policy limits.

$6B+ invested in enterprise AI — this is the payments piece of that puzzle.

### Email 17: Max Levchin (SciFi VC)

**Subject:** PayPal for AI agents — from a payment infra builder

**Body:**

Hi Max,

You built PayPal for humans, then Affirm for point-of-sale. The third act of payments: infrastructure for AI agents.

Building Sardis — virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC custody, enterprise compliance. When an AI agent transacts, Sardis checks the policy, issues a virtual card, executes, logs the receipt. Agent-native, not human-rails-retrofitted.

With 100+ fintech investments through SciFi, you know what good payment infra looks like. This is it, but for agents.

### Email 18: Immad Akhund (Mercury)

**Subject:** Mercury for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Immad,

Mercury made banking beautiful for startups. The next banking customer isn't a startup — it's an AI agent.

Building Sardis: virtual cards, natural language spending policies, MPC key management, enterprise compliance. Agent gets a financial identity, spends within policy limits, logs everything.

With 120+ angel investments in fintech and infra, you've seen this pattern: new user type emerges → needs native financial infrastructure → someone builds it.

### Email 19: Zach Perret (Plaid)

**Subject:** Plaid connected data. Sardis connects wallets to agents.

**Body:**

Hi Zach,

Plaid gave apps access to financial data. Sardis gives AI agents the ability to spend money.

Building: virtual cards (Lithic), natural language spending policies, MPC key management, enterprise compliance. When an AI agent needs to buy, refund, or settle — Sardis is the payment layer. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

You built the financial data layer. This is the financial action layer — for agents.

### Email 20: Dimitri Dadiomov (Modern Treasury)

**Subject:** Payment operations for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Dimitri,

Modern Treasury is payment operations for enterprises. Sardis is payment operations for AI agents.

Building: virtual cards, natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, approved vendors"), MPC key management, KYC/AML. When an AI agent processes a payment — Sardis checks policy, executes on card or on-chain rails, logs the operation.

You've spent years making payment ops programmable. We're making it agent-programmable — policies in plain English, execution fully autonomous.
