  - willing to run structured feedback loops
- Required acceptance conditions:
  - explicit acknowledgment of testnet/pre-prod constraints
  - agreement to share logs and integration feedback

## 3) Channel Execution

1. `X + Reddit public post`

   - target: 10+ qualified inbound conversations
2. `Selective outbound email`
   - source: `design-partner/03-outbound-email-template.md`
   - target: 20 hand-picked teams, 20–30% reply goal
3. `Warm intros`
   - target: 5 direct intros from founder network

## 4) Funnel and SLA

## 6) KPI Targets (Week 1)

## 7) Risks and Controls

- Risk: low-quality inbound leads  
  Control: enforce scorecard threshold before calls

  Control: repeat testnet-only/no-SLA terms in every channel
- Risk: solo-founder bandwidth  
  Control: cap active cohort at 2 partners until waiver closure
