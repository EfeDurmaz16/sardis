## 3. Launch Day Content

### 3.1 Twitter/X Launch Thread

```
1/ AI agents can book flights, manage calendars, and write code.

But they still can't safely spend money.

Until now.

Introducing Sardis - the Payment OS for the Agent Economy.

sardis.sh

---

2/ The problem is simple:

When you give an AI agent payment access, you're choosing between:

- Full access (one hallucination away from disaster)
- Manual approval for everything (defeats automation)

There's no middle ground. Until now.

---

3/ Sardis is a financial firewall for AI agents.

Every transaction passes through your policy engine before execution.

Define rules in plain English:
- "Max $50/day on subscriptions"
- "Only approved vendors"
- "Require approval over $200"

---

4/ The architecture:

- Non-custodial MPC wallets (your keys, always)
- Real-time policy enforcement
- Multi-chain support (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- USDC, USDT, EURC, PYUSD
- Full audit trail

You stay in control. Agents stay productive.

---

5/ Works with your stack:

- Claude Desktop / Cursor (MCP Server)
- LangChain (Python SDK)
- Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript)
- OpenAI Functions
- Any agent framework

One npm install. Zero config.

npm install @sardis/mcp-server

---

6/ Built on industry standards:

- AP2 (Google/PayPal/Visa/Mastercard protocol)
- TAP for cryptographic identity
- A2A for agent-to-agent payments
- UCP for commerce flows

We're not inventing new protocols. We're implementing the ones that matter.

---

7/ Use cases we're already seeing:

- Agents managing cloud spend
- Automated subscription renewals with caps
- Research assistants with API budgets
- Multi-agent systems with shared wallets
- Enterprise expense automation

---

8/ Open core model:

- SDKs are open source
- Self-host or use managed service
- Free tier: 100 transactions/month
- Pro: $49/month unlimited

We win when you ship.

---

9/ Why now?

AI agents will manage $1T+ in transactions by 2027.

The question isn't IF agents will handle money.

It's WHO will make it safe.

That's us.

---

10/ Join the waitlist for early access:

sardis.sh

Questions? We're here all day.

Let's build the financial layer for the agent economy together.
```

### 3.2 LinkedIn Launch Post

```
Today, we're publicly launching Sardis - the Payment OS for the Agent Economy.

Here's why this matters:

AI agents have crossed a capability threshold. They can research, code, manage projects, and make complex decisions. But there's one thing they still can't do safely: spend money.

The current solutions are inadequate:
1. Give agents your credit card (dangerous)
2. Approve every transaction manually (defeats automation)
3. Hope nothing goes wrong (not a strategy)

Sardis provides the missing layer: a policy engine that sits between agents and money.

What makes us different:

- Non-custodial architecture (we never hold your funds)
- Natural language policies ("Max $100/day, no gambling sites")
- Built on AP2/TAP standards (Google, PayPal, Visa backing)
- Multi-chain support (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- Works with any agent framework

We're looking for design partners who are building agent-powered products and need secure payment capabilities.

Early access: sardis.sh

The agent economy needs financial infrastructure. We're building it.

```

### 3.3 Reddit Launch Posts

**r/artificial - "We built a financial firewall for AI agents"**

```
Hey r/artificial,

We just launched Sardis - it's essentially a policy engine that sits between AI agents and payments.

The problem we're solving: AI agents are getting good at autonomous tasks, but giving them payment access is still terrifying. They hallucinate, they misunderstand context, they optimize for the wrong thing.

Our approach:
1. Agents get their own wallet (non-custodial, MPC-based)
2. You define spending policies in plain English
3. Every transaction is checked against your rules before execution
4. Full audit trail of what was spent and why

Technical stack:
- Works with Claude, GPT, LangChain, any framework
- Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Built on AP2/TAP protocols (the Google/PayPal/Visa standard)

We're early and looking for feedback. What policies would you want for your agents? What use cases are we missing?

Link: sardis.sh (waitlist is open)

Happy to answer any technical questions.
```

**r/LocalLLaMA - "Self-hosted payment infrastructure for local agents"**

```
For those running local models and building autonomous agents:

We open-sourced our Python SDK for Sardis - it's a payment policy engine for AI agents.

The core problem: your local agent needs to buy API credits, pay for services, make real transactions. But you don't want to give it raw access to your cards/accounts.

What we built:
- Non-custodial wallets (you control keys via MPC)
- Policy engine (spending limits, category restrictions, time windows)
- Audit logging
- Multi-chain support

Self-hostable:
- Policy engine (Python)
- SDK integrations
- Logging

Managed (or BYO providers):
- MPC key management (Turnkey)
- Chain execution
- Compliance checks

Works with any local model/agent framework. Just wraps your existing payment logic with safety rails.

GitHub: [link to SDK]
Docs: sardis.sh/docs

Looking for feedback from the local-first community. What would make this more useful for self-hosted setups?
