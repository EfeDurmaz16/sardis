### Maker's First Comment

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], and I've been obsessed with one question:
How do we let AI agents spend money without giving them the keys to the kingdom?

The Problem:
AI agents are getting smarter. They can book flights, order supplies, manage subscriptions.
But every current solution requires either:
- Giving agents full access to your credit card (terrifying)
- Manual approval for every transaction (defeats the purpose)

Our Solution - Sardis:
- Non-custodial MPC wallets (you always control the funds)
- Natural language spending policies ("max $100/day on AWS")
- Full AP2 protocol support (Google, PayPal, Mastercard standard)
- Complete audit trail

I'd love your feedback:
1. What spending policies would you want for your AI agents?
2. What integrations matter most to you?

Happy to answer any questions! 🙏

## Competitive Positioning

### Positioning Statement

> "We're not competing with Stripe or payment processors.
> We're the POLICY LAYER that sits on top of any payment rail.
> Think: what Cloudflare is to web traffic, Sardis is to agent payments."

### vs Key Competitors

| Competitor | Their Weakness | Our Strength |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Skyfire** | Custodial, no compliance | Non-custodial, full KYC/AML |
| **Nevermined** | No KYC/AML, crypto-only | Integrated compliance, virtual cards |
| **Payman AI** | Bank custody, agent-to-human only | MPC custody, A2A payments |
| **Traditional APIs** | No agent-specific features | Natural language policies |

### Response Playbook

**If competitor raises funding:**
- Don't acknowledge publicly
- Double down on differentiation content
- Accelerate partnership announcements

**If competitor launches similar feature:**
- Publish technical deep-dive on our implementation
- Highlight what we do better
- Focus on customer success stories
