## ICP DEFINITION & SEGMENTATION

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Dimension | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| **Stage** | Post-seed or later, actively shipping AI agent product |
| **Team** | Technical co-founder or CTO available for weekly sync |
| **Agent maturity** | Agents already interacting with financial data or payment rails |
| **Pain** | Agents need to move money, but security/policy controls are missing or manual |
| **Willingness** | Open to testnet-only, pre-production integration with feedback loops |

### Four ICP Segments

**Segment A — Agent Payment Infra (Direct Competitors / Collaborators)**
Companies building payment infrastructure for AI agents. Sardis can collaborate on protocol standards, share design surface, or offer complementary capabilities (MPC wallets, MCP server, virtual cards).

Value Prop: *"We're both building the agent payment stack. Let's compare notes on protocol design and share what we're learning from integrators."*

Companies: Locus, Orthogonal, Maven, Top Road

---

**Segment B — AI Agents That Move Money**
Companies whose AI agents already execute financial transactions (billing, collections, procurement, trading). They need a safe, policy-controlled payment execution layer.

Value Prop: *"Your agents already make financial decisions. Sardis gives them a wallet with natural language spending policies so they can execute payments autonomously — without giving up key custody."*

Companies: LedgerUp, Fazeshift, Veritus, Peakflo, Kastle, Scalar Field, Concourse, Mantle, ECSA, FlyCode, Skyvern

---

**Segment C — Compliance & Risk for Agent Payments**
Companies building compliance, KYC/AML, or risk infrastructure that agents use. Sardis is the payment execution layer that plugs into their compliance decisions.

Value Prop: *"Your agents decide who's allowed to transact. Sardis enforces how much and how they transact — programmable spending policies on non-custodial wallets, with full audit trail."*

Companies: Coris, Ballerine, Arva AI, Greenlite, Fenrock AI

---

**Segment D — AI-Powered Fintech (Adjacent)**
Companies in fintech/payments using AI but not building agents directly. Sardis may be useful as their products evolve toward autonomous execution.

Value Prop: *"As your product moves toward autonomous agent workflows, you'll need payment infrastructure built for agents — not retrofitted from human payment rails."*

Companies: Corgi Labs, Cosmic, Pearson Labs

## SEGMENT A: AGENT PAYMENT INFRA

---

### Email 1: Locus (F25)

**Subject:** Fellow agent payment builder — comparing notes?

**Body:**

Hi Cole,

I saw Locus's launch — payment infrastructure for AI agents with ACP reference implementation. We're building in the same space.

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis (YC applicant). We're approaching agent payments from the MPC wallet + natural language policy angle — non-custodial wallets where agents get spending authority through plain English rules, plus virtual cards via Lithic for fiat rails.

Since you're focused on corporate payment policies and we're focused on the custody + policy engine layer, I think there's a real conversation about where these overlap and where they complement.

Would you be open to a 30-min call to compare architectures? Not a sales pitch — genuinely curious how you're handling the MPC vs. custodial tradeoff.

### Email 2: Orthogonal (W26)

**Subject:** MCP-native payments — we should talk

**Body:**

Hi Christian,

Saw that Orthogonal is building agentic payments for APIs with MCP integration — we're building in a very similar corner.

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis. We built an MCP server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop — agents get non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. Think: "max $50/day on API calls, only whitelisted vendors."

Your pay-per-call model for API access + our policy-enforced wallet execution could be a powerful combo for Claude agents. An agent calls Orthogonal for the API, Sardis enforces the budget.

Worth a 30-min call to explore whether an integration makes sense? Both MCP-native, same target user.

### Email 3: Maven (W26)

**Subject:** Payment infra for voice agents — curious about your approach

**Body:**

Hi Brandon,

Congrats on Maven's growth — $7M ARR and 40+ enterprise customers handling voice payments is impressive. PCI-DSS + HIPAA certified voice agents solving a real problem.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. We give agents non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies and virtual cards. Different wedge (developer-facing, MCP-native), but same fundamental problem: agents need safe payment execution.

I'd love to hear how you approached PCI compliance for voice agent payments — it's a challenge we'll face as we move to production. And if there's an angle where Sardis wallets could serve as a settlement layer for Maven's voice agents, even better.

### Email 4: Top Road (W22)

**Subject:** GPT monetization → agent-native payments

**Body:**

Hi Jeevika,

I've been following Top Road's work on GPT monetization — letting creators accept payments directly in chat is exactly the direction the market's heading.

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis. We're building payment infrastructure specifically for AI agents — non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, and virtual cards via Lithic. We started from the "agents spending money" side, but the "agents earning money" side (what you're doing) is equally important.

Curious if you've thought about moving beyond PayPal as the settlement layer. Stablecoin settlement on Base or Polygon would give creators instant, low-fee payouts. That's something we could potentially provide.

## SEGMENT B: AI AGENTS THAT MOVE MONEY

---

### Email 5: Skyvern (W24)

**Subject:** Giving Skyvern agents a wallet

**Body:**

Hi Suchintan,

Skyvern's approach to browser automation is exactly where autonomous payments become critical — your agents navigate to checkout pages, fill forms, make purchases. But right now they probably need someone to paste in card details or pre-authorize everything manually.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. The flow: Skyvern agent hits a checkout → calls Sardis API → Sardis checks policy ("max $500/day on procurement") → returns a Lithic virtual card number → agent completes purchase.

No manual card entry. Policy-enforced. Full audit trail.

We're running a paid design partner program on testnet. Would love to explore this integration.

### Email 6: LedgerUp (S24)

**Subject:** Closing the loop: Ari sends invoices → Sardis collects payments

**Body:**

Hi Joseph,

Love what you're building with Ari — AI agent that handles the full contract-to-cash workflow. Extracting terms, generating invoices, chasing collections. The missing piece: autonomous payment execution.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. We give AI agents non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. For LedgerUp, the angle: Ari detects a signed contract → generates invoice → Sardis wallet autonomously processes the payment or issues a refund, all within policies you define in plain English.

We're looking for 1-2 design partners building billing/revenue agents. Paid beta on testnet, $1.5-2k/month, weekly syncs.

### Email 7: Fazeshift (S24)

**Subject:** From AR automation to autonomous settlement

**Body:**

Hi Caitlin,

Congrats on the $4M seed from Gradient — AI agent for AR is a space with real pull. Right now Fazeshift automates invoicing, reminders, and cash application. The natural next step: agents that can also execute settlements and payment incentives autonomously.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Think: your AR agent detects a customer 30 days overdue → Sardis policy allows "offer 2% early payment discount" → agent issues a virtual card credit or stablecoin payment within the approved budget.

We're running a paid design partner program on testnet. Your AR agents + our payment execution = full autonomous cash cycle.

### Email 8: Veritus (S25)

**Subject:** Secure payment execution for lending agents

**Body:**

Hi Joshua,

$10.1M seed for AI agents in consumer lending — clearly the market's ready. Your voice agents already negotiate payment plans and process settlements. The question: how do you enforce spending limits when agents are making autonomous payment decisions at scale?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. For Veritus: "agent can accept settlements up to $5,000, no discount over 15%, require human approval above $10k." Enforced at the wallet level, full audit trail, non-custodial so you never lose custody.

We're looking for design partners whose agents already move money. Veritus seems like a perfect fit.

### Email 9: Peakflo (W22)

**Subject:** From payment approval to payment execution

**Body:**

Hi Saurabh,

Peakflo's agentic workflows are impressive — 100+ teams saving 2,000 man-hours/month on AP/AR automation. Your agents already approve payments. The next unlock: agents that also execute them.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. We give AI agents non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies. For Peakflo: agents approve a vendor payment → Sardis executes it on-chain or via virtual card → settlement in minutes, not days. Policy: "auto-pay verified vendors under $10k, flag new vendors."

We're running a paid testnet beta for design partners. Your finance automation agents + our payment execution layer = full autonomous procure-to-pay.

### Email 10: Kastle (S24)

**Subject:** Post-collection payment routing for mortgage agents

**Body:**

Hi Rishi,

Voice AI agents handling mortgage servicing calls and reducing call center costs by 90% — that's a strong wedge. I'm curious: after your agent qualifies a payment from a borrower, how does the actual settlement flow work today?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, virtual cards. For Kastle: voice agent negotiates payment plan → Sardis wallet executes the collection within policy limits → full audit trail for mortgage compliance.

Your regulated environment is exactly where non-custodial, policy-enforced payments matter most. We're running a paid design partner program on testnet.

### Email 11: Scalar Field (Sp25)

**Subject:** Spending policies for trading agents

**Body:**

Hi Amandeep,

$74k MRR and 800+ paying traders — Scalar Field is growing fast. Your agents analyze markets, backtest strategies, and execute trades. The risk control layer is critical: how do you prevent an agent from blowing through a position limit?

I'm Efe, building Sardis. We give AI agents non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language risk policies. For Scalar Field: "max 5% portfolio drawdown per trade, no single position over $100k, daily loss limit $2,000." Enforced at the wallet level before execution, not after.

If you're thinking about DeFi or crypto trading support, our multi-chain wallets (Base, Polygon, Ethereum) + policy engine could be a natural fit.

### Email 12: Concourse (W23)

**Subject:** Adding payment execution to finance agents

**Body:**

Hi Matthieu,

Congrats on the Series A — 50+ customers including Fortune 500 for AI-powered corporate finance is serious traction. Your agents already connect to ERPs, billing systems, and expense tools. The natural evolution: agents that don't just analyze and report, but also execute payments.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. For Concourse: agent identifies a vendor payment due in NetSuite → Sardis policy checks ("approved vendor, under $5k threshold") → executes payment → logged in audit trail.

Your Python-first approach aligns perfectly with our SDK. We're looking for design partners expanding from financial analysis to financial execution.

### Email 13: Mantle (F25)

**Subject:** One-prompt payment automation

**Body:**

Hi Samrath,

Love the vision — "build internal agents with one prompt." Your agents already connect to Stripe, CRMs, and calendars. Adding autonomous payment execution would be a powerful unlock: "when Stripe shows unpaid invoice > 60 days and HubSpot shows customer NRR > 100%, send payment reminder + offer 1% discount."

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies, exactly matching your one-prompt paradigm. Mantle agents could be the first to offer prompt-driven payment automation.

We're early-stage (F25, same batch timing as you) and looking for design partners. Testnet-only, paid beta.

### Email 14: ECSA (S22)

**Subject:** Autonomous cross-border trade payments

**Body:**

Hi Joao,

An AI agent running the entire international trade operation — customs, compliance, cross-border payments — is ambitious and exactly the right direction. The payment piece across borders and jurisdictions is where things get complex fast.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Non-custodial MPC wallets, multi-chain settlement (Base, Polygon, Ethereum), natural language policies. For ECSA: "pay supplier only after customs clearance confirmed, max $50k per shipment, USDC on Base for lowest fees."

Your agents need trustless payment execution across jurisdictions without intermediaries. That's exactly our architecture.

### Email 15: FlyCode (S22)

**Subject:** Agent-controlled funds for payment recovery

**Body:**

Hi Etai,

16-25% increase in payment recovery rates through AI retry optimization — strong numbers. Your ML makes autonomous decisions about when, how, and where to retry failed payments. Curious: have you thought about giving the retry agent its own spending authority?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial wallets with spending policies for AI agents. For FlyCode: retry agent gets a Sardis wallet with policy "up to 3 retries per failed payment, max $50/customer, alternate card routing allowed." Agent draws from the wallet to fund retry credits or customer win-back offers.

We're looking for design partners whose agents already make autonomous payment decisions. FlyCode's ML + Sardis's policy-enforced wallets could be a strong combo.

## SEGMENT C: COMPLIANCE & RISK

---

### Email 16: Coris (S22)

**Subject:** Spending policies that match your risk playbooks

**Body:**

Hi Shyam,

Coris's risk playbooks are exactly what payment processors need — 90%+ instant approval rates with AI-driven fraud detection. Your agents auto-approve, pause, or block transactions. But after approval, the spending side still needs guardrails.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. The integration: Coris identifies a merchant's risk tier → Sardis automatically applies matching spending policies on that merchant's wallet. High-risk merchant? "Max $1,000/day, no international transactions." Low-risk? "Standard limits."

Your risk decisions → our spending enforcement = end-to-end automated merchant controls.

### Email 17: Ballerine (S22)

**Subject:** Agent commerce governance + payment execution

**Body:**

Hi Noam,

Saw the Trusted Agentic Commerce Governance Platform launch — you're clearly seeing the same thing we are: AI agents mediating merchant transactions is creating a new compliance layer that didn't exist before.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial wallets, natural language spending policies, full audit trail. Ballerine governs which merchants meet agent-commerce standards; Sardis enforces how those merchants' agents can transact. Your compliance decision → our payment execution.

The combined pitch to PSPs: verify (Ballerine) → execute safely (Sardis) → audit trail for everything.

### Email 18: Arva AI (S24)

**Subject:** KYC tier → spending policy, automatically

**Body:**

Hi Rhim,

Arva's compliance automation is impressive — 91% of sanctions alerts filtered automatically, instant KYB/KYC across 140+ jurisdictions. Google's AI fund clearly agrees this is the right problem.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. Here's the integration angle: Arva determines a counterparty's risk tier → Sardis automatically applies matching spending policies. Low risk = standard limits. Medium risk = reduced daily cap + category restrictions. High risk = blocked.

Your agents answer "is this entity allowed to transact?" Sardis answers "what restrictions apply to their transactions?" Sequential infra, natural partnership.

### Email 19: Greenlite (S23)

**Subject:** Pre-transaction policy + post-transaction compliance

**Body:**

Hi Will,

Congrats on the $15M Series A — AI agents for financial compliance at Mercury, Ramp, Betterment, Gusto. Serious customers building serious trust in your compliance agents.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. Here's where we fit together: Sardis enforces policies before transactions (spend limits, recipient restrictions, category blocks). Greenlite reviews transactions after (AML monitoring, audit narratives, regulatory reporting).

Together: preventive controls (Sardis) + detective controls (Greenlite) = end-to-end compliance for agent-driven payments. Your regulated bank customers will need this as they deploy financial agents.

**Subject:** W26 → W26: agent payment compliance

**Body:**

Hi Charu,

Fellow W26 batch — congrats on building agent-driven financial crime compliance. As AI agents start executing real financial transactions, the audit trail becomes everything.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement. Every Sardis transaction generates structured audit data: policy evaluation logs, multi-sig approval records, chain settlement receipts.

Your agents could consume this data to auto-generate compliance narratives for agent-executed payments. Sardis provides the transaction evidence → Fenrock provides the compliance verification.

### Email 21: Corgi Labs (W23)

**Subject:** Fraud ML for on-chain agent payments

**Body:**

Hi Saif,

Corgi Labs' ensemble ML for payment acceptance and fraud prevention — 0.2% GMV uplift and 5% revenue unblocked — is strong. Your models make autonomous accept/reject decisions for traditional PSPs.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial wallets with spending policies for AI agents. As autonomous agents start making on-chain payments (stablecoins, DeFi), fraud detection becomes critical. Your ML models + Sardis's policy layer: "execute payment only if Corgi Labs fraud score < threshold."

This brings your fraud intelligence into the agent payment world, which is currently the wild west for fraud detection.

### Email 22: Cosmic (F24)

**Subject:** Agent-built sites that handle their own payments

**Body:**

Hi Sam,

Cosmic's vision — AI builds full-stack websites with built-in monetization in minutes — is where development is heading. Right now you're using Stripe for payments. As agents build and manage entire applications, they'll need payment infrastructure they can control autonomously.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. For Cosmic: the agent that builds the site also manages its billing. Natural language policy: "charge subscribers $29/month, pause after 3 failed payments, refund within 30-day window." All through a non-custodial wallet the agent controls.

If you're thinking about agent-managed monetization beyond Stripe, would love to share what we're building.

### Email 23: Pearson Labs (F24)

**Subject:** Autonomous escrow for M&A transaction agents

**Body:**

Hi Stephanie,

AI agents doing weeks of M&A due diligence in hours — and partnered with Orrick. Impressive. As your agents expand from document analysis to transaction execution, the payment coordination layer becomes critical.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies for AI agents. The long-term angle for Pearson Labs: agent-managed escrow. Agent detects closing conditions met → Sardis wallet releases funds per policy → multi-party MPC approval (buyer, seller, escrow agent). Programmatic, auditable, no intermediary.

This might be 6-12 months out for your roadmap, but happy to share how we're approaching multi-party payment coordination if you're thinking about it.

AI accountant for accounting firms with a 13-person team — clearly you've found product-market fit in automating financial workflows. As your AI accountant evolves from bookkeeping to execution, it'll need payment rails it can operate autonomously.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. For Cifrato: AI accountant verifies an invoice → Sardis policy checks ("approved vendor, matches PO, under $5k") → executes payment → logs to audit trail. Your accountant goes from recording transactions to executing them.

## MISSING: ALTER (S25) — BONUS HIGH-PRIORITY EMAIL

### Email 0: Alter (S25) — SEND WEEK 1

**Subject:** Auth layer + payment layer = safe agent spending

**Body:**

Hi Srikar,

Alter's zero-trust access control for agent workflows is exactly the authorization layer that's been missing. Parameter-level verification, ephemeral credentials, RBAC/ABAC for agents — you're solving the "should this agent be allowed to do this?" question.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. We solve the "how does this agent safely execute a payment?" question. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, virtual cards, multi-chain settlement.

The natural integration: Alter verifies the agent's authorization → Sardis executes the payment within enforced spending policies. Together: compliant agentic payments from auth to settlement.
