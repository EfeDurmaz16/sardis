## TIER 1 INVESTOR EMAILS

### Email 1: Coinbase Ventures

**Subject:** Agent payments on Base — Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Coinbase Ventures team,

Building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Agents get MPC wallets with natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, only whitelisted vendors"), multi-chain settlement starting with Base + USDC, and virtual cards via Lithic.

We're live on testnet with an MCP server (36 tools for Claude Desktop) and Python/TypeScript SDKs. Running a paid design partner cohort with YC-backed AI agent companies.

Sardis is native Base infrastructure — every agent transaction settles on Base with USDC. This is the payment layer the agent economy is missing.

Would love to share more: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 2: Circle Ventures

**Subject:** USDC settlement layer for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Circle Ventures team,

Sardis is a non-custodial payment OS for AI agents — MPC wallets with natural language spending policies, settling in USDC across Base, Polygon, and Ethereum.

Every Sardis transaction is a USDC transaction. Agents define budgets in plain English, execute payments within policy, and settle in stablecoins. Plus virtual cards via Lithic for fiat bridge.

We're live on testnet with an MCP server for Claude Desktop (36 tools) and running paid design partner cohort. Multiple YC-backed AI agent companies in pipeline.

USDC as the native settlement currency for the agent economy — would love to discuss: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 3: Polygon Ventures

**Subject:** Agent payment infrastructure on Polygon

**Body:**

Hi Polygon Ventures team,

Building Sardis — the payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, and multi-chain settlement. Polygon is one of our primary chains (alongside Base and Ethereum) for USDC/USDT settlement.

Why Polygon: low gas fees make agent micro-transactions viable. An AI agent making 100 API payments/day needs sub-cent gas — that's Polygon.

We're on testnet with an MCP server for Claude Desktop, Python/TypeScript SDKs, and a paid design partner pipeline of YC-backed AI companies.

Happy to walk through the architecture: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 4: a16z Crypto (CSX)

**Subject:** Non-custodial wallets for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi a16z CSX team,

AI agents can reason. They can't be trusted with money. Sardis is how they earn that trust.

We're building non-custodial payment infrastructure for AI agents: MPC wallets (Turnkey), natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement (Base/Polygon/ETH), virtual cards (Lithic), and an MCP server for Claude Desktop with 36 payment tools.

The agent economy needs payment rails that are non-custodial, policy-enforced, and auditable. Not a Stripe wrapper — actual agent-native financial infrastructure.

Testnet live, paid design partner pipeline with YC-backed agent companies. Applying to YC S26.

Would love 30 minutes: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 5: Paradigm

**Subject:** Payment protocol for autonomous agents

**Body:**

Hi Paradigm team,

Sardis is building the payment protocol for AI agents — non-custodial MPC wallets where agents get spending authority through natural language policies, not raw key access.

Architecture: Turnkey MPC custody, AP2/TAP protocol compliance, KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic), virtual cards (Lithic), multi-chain (Base/Polygon/ETH). 36-tool MCP server for Claude Desktop. Python + TypeScript SDKs.

The thesis: agents will control more capital than humans within 5 years. The infrastructure for that doesn't exist yet. We're building it.

Testnet live, YC-backed design partners in pipeline.

### Email 6: Pantera Capital

**Subject:** Stablecoin payment rails for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Pantera team,

Two mega-trends converging: stablecoin adoption and autonomous AI agents. Sardis sits at the intersection — non-custodial payment OS where AI agents transact in USDC/USDT across Base, Polygon, and Ethereum.

Agents get MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. Think: "max $50/day on API calls, only whitelisted vendors, USDC on Base." Enforced at the wallet level, not application layer.

MCP server for Claude Desktop (36 tools), Python/TypeScript SDKs, KYC/AML built in. Testnet live with paid design partner pipeline.

### Email 7: Better Tomorrow Ventures (The Mint)

**Subject:** Pre-seed fintech — AI agent payment infra

**Body:**

Hi BTV / Mint team,

Sardis = payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, virtual cards, multi-chain settlement. The financial infrastructure layer for autonomous agents.

Why now: AI agents are becoming economically viable (post-o1, reasoning costs dropping) but enterprises won't deploy agents with financial authority without guardrails. Sardis provides those guardrails.

Solo founder, testnet live, MCP server for Claude Desktop (36 tools), Python/TypeScript SDKs. Paid design partner pipeline with YC-backed AI agent companies. Applying to YC S26 and PearX S26.

The Mint's fintech-first thesis + pre-seed check size = perfect fit: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 8: PearX / Pear VC

**Subject:** PearX S26 — Sardis (Payment OS for AI Agents)

**Body:**

Hi Pear VC team,

Applying to PearX S26 with Sardis — the payment OS for the agent economy. Non-custodial MPC wallets (Turnkey), natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement, virtual cards (Lithic), MCP server for Claude Desktop.

We're on testnet with a paid design partner pipeline targeting YC-backed AI agent companies. Solo founder, deep technical background, based in Istanbul.

The market: AI agents will control more financial transactions than humans. The infrastructure for safe, policy-enforced agent payments doesn't exist yet.

Would love to connect before the application deadline: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 9: Ribbit Capital

**Subject:** Embedded finance for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Ribbit team,

Sardis is embedding financial infrastructure into AI agents — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. The same thesis as embedded finance, but for agents instead of apps.

Architecture: Turnkey MPC, multi-chain (Base/Polygon/ETH), virtual cards (Lithic), MCP server for Claude, KYC/AML built in. Testnet live, paid design partners.

Every SaaS platform embedding payments = Ribbit's thesis. Every AI agent embedding payments = Sardis.

### Email 10: Variant Fund

**Subject:** Token incentives for autonomous agent payments

**Body:**

Hi Variant team,

Sardis is building non-custodial payment infrastructure for AI agents — MPC wallets with natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement in USDC.

Variant's thesis on crypto incentives and ownership applies directly: agents that earn and spend through programmable, policy-enforced wallets. The ownership economy extends to autonomous agents.

Testnet live with MCP server for Claude Desktop (36 tools), Python/TypeScript SDKs, KYC/AML. Paid design partner pipeline.

Would love to discuss the agent ownership angle: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 11: Hack VC

**Subject:** MPC wallet infrastructure for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Hack VC team,

Sardis is building payment infrastructure for AI agents using MPC custody (Turnkey), natural language spending policies, and multi-chain settlement. The non-custodial approach means agents get spending authority without raw key access — critical for enterprise adoption.

Your portfolio includes crypto infrastructure plays. Sardis is the infrastructure layer between AI agents and on-chain money. Testnet live, MCP server for Claude Desktop, paid design partner pipeline.

### Email 12: Dragonfly Capital

**Subject:** Cross-chain agent payments

**Body:**

Hi Dragonfly team,

AI agents need to transact across chains without custodial risk. Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, settlement on Base/Polygon/Ethereum with USDC/USDT.

Dragonfly's cross-chain infrastructure thesis applies directly — agents don't care which chain is cheapest; they need abstracted, policy-enforced payment execution across all of them.

Testnet live, MCP server for Claude Desktop, Python/TypeScript SDKs. Paid design partners from YC ecosystem.

### Email 13: Founders Fund

**Subject:** The PayPal for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Founders Fund team,

PayPal enabled humans to transact online. Sardis enables AI agents to transact autonomously — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies.

Architecture: Turnkey MPC, AP2/TAP protocol compliance, KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic), virtual cards (Lithic), multi-chain settlement. MCP server for Claude Desktop with 36 tools.

Agents will control more capital than humans within a decade. The payment infrastructure for that shift doesn't exist. We're building it from the protocol layer.

Testnet live, YC-backed design partner pipeline. Applying to YC S26.

### Email 14: General Catalyst

**Subject:** Applied AI infrastructure — agent payments

**Body:**

Hi GC team,

Sardis is applied AI infrastructure for payments — giving AI agents non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies so they can execute real financial transactions safely.

Not a wrapper on Stripe. Actual agent-native payment infrastructure: MPC custody, policy enforcement before execution, virtual cards, multi-chain settlement, and a 36-tool MCP server for Claude Desktop.

The market's moving fast — AI agent companies are deploying financial agents without proper payment guardrails. Sardis provides those guardrails. Testnet live, paid design partner pipeline.

### Email 15: Khosla Ventures

**Subject:** Deep tech payment infra for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi Khosla team,

Sardis is building from first principles: the payment infrastructure AI agents need doesn't exist. Stripe is for humans. Agents need non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies — "max $500/day, only whitelisted vendors, USDC on Base."

We've built: Turnkey MPC integration, AP2/TAP protocol compliance, KYC/AML, Lithic virtual cards, multi-chain settlement, and a 36-tool MCP server for Claude Desktop.

Deep tech, not a SaaS wrapper. Testnet live, paid design partner pipeline with YC-backed agent companies.

### Email 16: Elad Gil

**Subject:** Agent payment infrastructure — pre-seed

**Body:**

Hi Elad,

Building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement, virtual cards. The financial infrastructure for the agent economy.

Given your investments in AI infra (OpenAI, Coinbase ecosystem), Sardis sits exactly at the intersection: agents need to move money safely, and the rails don't exist yet.

Testnet live, 36-tool MCP server for Claude Desktop, Python/TypeScript SDKs. Paid design partner pipeline with YC-backed AI agent companies.

Pre-seed stage. Would love your perspective: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 17: Naval Ravikant

**Subject:** Crypto + AI agents = Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Naval,

Two of your biggest conviction areas — crypto and AI — are converging. AI agents need to transact. Current payment rails (Stripe, banks) don't support autonomous actors.

Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets for AI agents. Natural language spending policies. Multi-chain stablecoin settlement. Virtual cards. An MCP server that lets Claude make real payments within enforced limits.

The agent economy needs its own payment infrastructure, built from the protocol layer. That's what we're building.

### Email 18: Balaji Srinivasan

**Subject:** Agent-native payment infrastructure

**Body:**

Hi Balaji,

The network state needs payment infrastructure that works for autonomous agents, not just humans. Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain stablecoin settlement.

The thesis: AI agents will control more transactions than humans. They need programmatic financial guardrails — policy-enforced spending, auditable trails, non-custodial custody. Not Stripe with an API key.

Testnet live, MCP server for Claude Desktop, Python/TypeScript SDKs. Pre-seed stage.

Would value your perspective: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 20: Patrick & John Collison (Stripe Angels)

**Subject:** Stripe for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Patrick / John,

Stripe enabled internet commerce. AI agents need their own payment infrastructure — and it's fundamentally different from human payment rails.

Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets where agents get spending authority through natural language policies. Virtual cards for fiat. Multi-chain stablecoins for crypto. KYC/AML built in. MCP server for Claude Desktop.

You built the payment layer for the internet economy. We're building it for the agent economy. Same vision, different actor.

Testnet live, paid design partners, applying to YC S26.
