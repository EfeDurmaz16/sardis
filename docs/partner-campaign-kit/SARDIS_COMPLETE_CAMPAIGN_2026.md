# SARDIS GTM + FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN KIT 2026

## SECTION 1: ASSUMPTIONS AND SCOPE

### Core Assumptions
1. **Founder Bandwidth**: 30-60 min/day available for marketing (mon-fri), concentrated in async content
2. **Product Stage**: Testnet-only, no production revenue, design partner cohort < 50 companies
3. **Market Timing**: AI agent economy is nascent but accelerating (Q4 2025-Q2 2026 is critical window)
4. **Credibility Over Scale**: Founder has deep technical credibility; leads should be warm, qualified, and few
5. **Distribution Channels**: Twitter/X is primary (async, searchable, algorithmic reach), Reddit second, email/DMs third
6. **Compliance as Feature**: KYC + AML integrated; messaging must be legally bulletproof
7. **Solo Operation**: No external agency, no paid ads, organic only

### Critical Information Gaps & Workarounds
| Gap | Impact | Workaround |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| No existing customer testimonials | Credibility limited | Lead with founder story + protocol compliance as proof |
| Testnet-only (no production metrics) | Can't claim transaction volume | Focus on design partner cohort quality + protocol coverage |
| Limited design partner data yet | Can't reference specific wins | Use technical moat (MPC + policies) as credibility proxy |
| Founder is solo, Istanbul-based | Limited US timezone flexibility | Schedule async content; use reply templates for async engagement |
| No paid budget | Reach is organic only | Compensate with high reply-trigger quality + strategic communities |

### Scope Boundaries
- **IN SCOPE**: Testnet design partner acquisition, investor soft intros, thought leadership positioning
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Paid ads, growth hacks that require fabricated metrics, production customer sales
- **COMPLIANCE GUARDRAIL**: All messaging must avoid claiming: real-money flows, production readiness, customer base size (use "design partners" language only)

---

## SECTION 2: UNIFIED STRATEGY

### The One-Page Strategy

**Why Now:**
- AI agents can execute transactions autonomously, but enterprises won't deploy agents with financial authority without guardrails
- Existing payment solutions (Stripe, Coinbase) treat agents as dumb routing layers; they don't enforce policy
- Post-OpenAI o1 launch, reasoning costs are dropping—agents are becoming economically viable for mid-market use cases
- Regulatory clarity on AI financial controls (EU AI Act, SEC guidance on algorithmic trading) creates urgency

**What Sardis Solves:**
Non-custodial, policy-enforceable payments infrastructure for AI agents. Users never give up key control. Agents can earn trust through auditable spending limits.

**Wedge Use Cases (in priority order):**
1. **B2B SaaS Automation** (e.g., AI customer success agents that can issue refunds, process rebates within policy)
2. **Autonomous Research/Trading** (agents with hard-coded position size limits, approval gates)
3. **AI Procurement & Vendor Mgmt** (agents with budget caps, approval workflows)

**Why-Now Framing:**

*For Design Partners (CTO/VP Eng):*
"Your AI agent won't get financial authority without guardrails. We've built the guardrails—non-custodial, auditable, protocol-native. Be first in your industry to ship agents with financial autonomy."

*For Investors (VCs/Angel):*
"Agents are moving from chat to transactions. Payment rails won't be commoditized—policy-aware, non-custodial infrastructure will be foundational. Sardis is the protocol layer that makes agent finance trustworthy."

### Core Positioning Statement
"The payment operating system for AI agents: policy-enforced, non-custodial, protocol-native infrastructure that lets enterprises deploy agents with real financial authority."

---

## SECTION 4: MESSAGING ARCHITECTURE

### Core Narrative (2-3 Sentences)
"AI agents can reason at superhuman scale now. But enterprises won't give them financial authority without guardrails. Sardis is the non-custodial payment operating system that makes agent transactions auditable, policy-enforced, and trustworthy—no key handoff required."

### Three Value Propositions

**VP1: Non-Custodial = User Control**
Agents execute transactions from users' own wallets (Turnkey MPC). You never give Sardis custody of funds. Full on-chain auditability. Compliance-friendly architecture.

**VP2: Natural Language Policy = Speed**
Write spending limits in English. "This agent can approve refunds up to $500, but not on Mondays." Policies compile to smart contract rules. No smart contract code required.

**VP3: Protocol-Native = Future-Proof**
AP2/TAP/x402 compliant. Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism). Built on open standards, not proprietary rails.

### Five Objection-Response Pairs

| Objection | Response | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **"This sounds complex—we need something turnkey."** | "Turnkey is our entire posture. Lithic handles fiat bridging. Persona handles KYC. We handle policy + wallets. One API, fully integrated. Simpler than building in-house." | 4/5 |
| **"What if your service goes down? We lose transaction authority."** | "Policies live on-chain; agents fetch at runtime. If Sardis is down, agents still execute within stored policy. Graceful degradation by design. You're not dependent on Sardis uptime." | 5/5 |
| **"How do we trust that policies are enforced?"** | "Every transaction is auditable on-chain. Full policy log, signature chain, MPC threshold. Third-party compliance can verify. Not trust-me, verify-me architecture." | 5/5 |
| **"What's your roadmap? What if you pivot to mainnet and charge differently?"** | "We're protocol-first, not platform-first. Sardis the company could disappear; policies continue on-chain. We've committed to open-source the MPC + policy engine within 2 years. You're not locked in." | 3/5 |
| **"We're worried about regulatory risk. What if authorities say this isn't compliant?"** | "We've integrated KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) from day one. Policies are more conservative than existing regs. If anything, we de-risk your liability by creating an audit trail. We also stay close to SEC + EU AI Act guidance." | 4/5 |

### CTA Matrix (Audience × Channel)

| Audience | X/Twitter | Reddit | Email/DM | In-person |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Design Partner (CTO)** | "DM for testnet access" | "Comment: 'We're looking for design partners—DM me'" | "Book a 30-min call to see if fit" | "Let's grab coffee—I'll show you the demo" |
| **Investor (VC/Angel)** | "Happy to chat about agent finance—DM" | (Avoid; not suitable) | "Quick intro call? I'd love your thoughts" | "Can we set up a 20-min call next week?" |
| **Developer** | "GitHub link—star us, try testnet" | "Build with us—here's the SDK" | (Avoid; focus on X) | (Avoid) |

### THREAD 1: FOUNDER STORY (MONDAY, 9AM ET)

**Position:** Establishes credibility, relatable problem, founding insight
**Goal:** 200+ replies, 1000+ bookmarks, 5k+ impressions
**Copy:**

Tweet 1:
"I've been thinking about AI agents for 2 years. Everyone talks about reasoning. Nobody talks about transactions.

Here's the problem I couldn't unsee: agents can think at superhuman scale. But enterprises won't let them touch money.

Not because they can't code a payment. Because they can't sleep at night."

Tweet 2:
"The current options are terrible:
- Custodial rails (Stripe, Coinbase): agent has key, you lose control
- In-house compliance: 6-month slog, 100k+ engineering
- Don't let agents do anything financial: agents stay dumb, useful only for chat

There's no middle ground."

Tweet 3:
"So I started Sardis: the non-custodial payment OS for agents.

Your agent executes transactions from your own wallet. Sardis enforces policy in code ('approve refunds under $500, never on Mondays'). Everything auditable on-chain.

The agent earns trust through guardrails, not gatekeeping."

Tweet 4:
"Why this matters:

SaaS companies could ship autonomous refund agents.
Trading firms could deploy agents with hard-coded position limits.
Procurement teams could let agents negotiate vendor terms, then execute within budget.

But first: guardrails. Policy. Auditability."

Tweet 5:
"We've built Sardis with:
- Non-custodial MPC wallets (Turnkey)
- Natural language policy engine (English → smart contract)
- Full AP2/TAP/x402 protocol compliance
- Integrated KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic)
- Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism)

Design partner cohort is live now."

Tweet 6:
"If your company is building agents that need financial authority, let's talk. DM me or visit sardis.sh

We're looking for 5-10 testnet design partners this quarter. You get early access + direct feedback loop with the team."

Tweet 7:
"This is testnet only. Real money won't move through Sardis until Q3 2026. We're being intentional about compliance from day 1.

But the time to build agent financial infrastructure is now. Before the market assumes custodial is the only way."

Tweet 8:
"Thoughts? What am I missing? How do you think about agent financial authority?

RT, reply, or DM. I read every response."

---

### THREAD 2: TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE (TUESDAY, 12PM ET)

**Position:** Establish technical credibility, explain moat
**Goal:** 150+ replies, 800+ bookmarks, engineer attention
**Copy:**

Tweet 1:
"Let me explain the Sardis architecture in technical detail. If you're building payment infrastructure, this might matter to you.

The core insight: policy ≠ custody."

Tweet 2:
"Most payment systems conflate two things:
1. **Policy enforcement** (rules: can't exceed $500, needs approval)
2. **Custody** (holding the key)

Stripe bundles them: you trust Stripe, they enforce policy.
We decouple them: you hold the key, smart contracts enforce policy.

Why? Non-custodial."

Tweet 3:
"Architecture:

Agent → Sardis SDK → Policy engine (off-chain) → MPC threshold (Turnkey) → Policy contract (on-chain) → Wallet execution

If Sardis goes down, agent still executes within stored policy. Graceful degradation."

Tweet 4:
"Non-custodial MPC via Turnkey:

Agent never knows the full key. Sardis never holds the key. Key is split across threshold signers. To move money, you need:
- Agent signature (intent)
- Sardis signature (policy check: did you stay within limits?)
- User approval (veto gate)

3-of-3 multisig abstracted away."

Tweet 5:
"Natural language policies compile to smart contract rules.

English: 'Approve refunds up to $500, but not on weekends, and require approval if > $200'

Compiles to: timelock, approval gate, amount check, day-of-week oracle. All on-chain."

Tweet 6:
"Protocol compliance: AP2 (Abstract Payment Protocol), TAP (Transaction Authorization Protocol), x402 (Billable APIs).

We're not building a silo. We're implementing open standards. Agents can port policies between payment systems."

Tweet 7:
"Multi-chain architecture:

Base (primary, cheap), Polygon (backup), Ethereum (high-value), Arbitrum/Optimism (scaling). Policies are chain-agnostic; agents pick best route based on asset + speed.

No lock-in to one L2."

Tweet 8:
"SDKs: Python + TypeScript. MCP server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop integration.

If you're an agent, you talk to Sardis via JSON-RPC. If you're a human, you interact via MCP or UI.

Open standards, multiple interfaces."

---

### THREAD 3: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (WEDNESDAY, 5PM ET - REPLY TO TRENDING)

**Position:** Thought leadership, differentiate from custodial
**Goal:** Piggyback trending post about agent economy; 200+ replies expected
**Context:** Reply to viral post about "AI agents need payment rails" or similar
**Copy:**

Tweet 1:
"Everyone's building agent payment rails right now. Let me unpack what's different about the approaches:

Custodial (Skyfire, Payman): Stripe for agents. Fast. Trusted. But you give up key control.
Non-custodial (Sardis, Nevermined): You keep the key. Policy enforced in code.

Pick your tradeoff."

Tweet 2:
"Custodial pros:
- Simpler UX (one company handles everything)
- Established compliance framework
- Clear liability line (custody provider = liable)

Custodial cons:
- Key risk (another company holds your money)
- Compliance burden falls on you anyway
- Lock-in to one provider's rules"

Tweet 3:
"Non-custodial pros:
- You keep the key (zero key risk)
- Policies auditable on-chain (can't be changed without your consent)
- Multi-chain + multi-provider (pick your backend)

Non-custodial cons:
- Slightly more complex integration
- Fewer established compliance playbooks (we're filling this gap)
- Requires self-custody discipline"

Tweet 4:
"Take: The enterprise buyer will want both. Non-custodial architecture + integrated compliance (KYC + AML).

That's where Sardis sits. You get user control + policy enforcement + compliance guardrails. No custodial risk, no compliance gap."

Tweet 5:
"If you're an enterprise building agents, the question isn't 'custodial or non-custodial?' It's 'do I want to sleep at night knowing my agent transactions are auditable, policy-enforced, and not held by a third party?'

Our answer: Sardis."

### 10 SHORT POSTS (READY TO POST, NO THREADS)

**Post 1 (Monday morning):**
"Your AI agent can reason at superhuman scale now. But enterprises won't give it financial authority without guardrails. That's why Sardis exists. Non-custodial. Policy-enforced. Auditable.

Testnet design partners: dm for access."

**Post 2 (Tuesday afternoon):**
"The payment stack for AI agents doesn't exist yet. Stripe wasn't built for autonomous transactions. Coinbase wasn't built for policy enforcement.

We're building what's missing: sardis.sh"

**Post 3 (Wednesday morning):**
"Natural language policies for agent spending: 'This agent can approve refunds under $500, but only Mon-Fri, and only if approval_count < 3'

Compiles to smart contract rules. Auditable on-chain.

No custom smart contract code needed."

**Post 4 (Thursday afternoon):**
"Design partners: we're looking for 5-10 SaaS / agent framework companies to test Sardis testnet.

You get early access, direct feedback loop with the team, and case study opportunity.

$1.5k-$2k/month. 3-month commitment.

DM if interested."

**Post 5 (Friday morning):**
"Why non-custodial for agents?

Because if your agent has a key, someone has to hold it. If Sardis holds it, we're a target. If you hold it, you sleep better.

We enforce policy in code, not in custody."

**Post 6 (Monday):**
"The agent economy won't scale without:
1. Reasoning (LLMs solved this)
2. Action (tools solved this)
3. Trust (payment guardrails solve this)

Sardis is #3."

**Post 7 (Tuesday):**
"Every payment system asks: who do you trust? Sardis asks a better question: what rules do you want to enforce?"

**Post 8 (Wednesday):**
"Multi-chain architecture because agents shouldn't care where liquidity lives. Sardis routes transactions across Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism based on cost + speed.

You just write the policy."

**Post 9 (Thursday):**
"Real question: if your agent can execute transactions, and those transactions are auditable + policy-enforced, is it more trustworthy or less?

I'd argue: more. Transparency builds trust."

**Post 10 (Friday):**
"Week 1 insights from design partners: the top blocker for autonomous agents isn't reasoning or tooling. It's 'how do we let our agent move money without losing sleep?'

That question has an answer now."

### 20 STRATEGIC REPLY TEMPLATES

These are ready-to-customize replies to common questions/discussions on X. Copy, modify [PLACEHOLDER] text, paste in reply.

**Technical Questions:**

**Reply 1 (MPC/Key Management):**
"Great question. MPC via Turnkey splits the key across signers. Agent can't move funds alone; needs both Sardis (policy check) + user (veto). This way, [PLACEHOLDER: specific threat model] is mitigated. We wrote a bit on the architecture here: sardis.sh/docs"

**Reply 2 (On-Chain Auditability):**
"Every transaction + policy check is auditable on-chain. You can verify policy compliance without trusting Sardis. Here's what the audit trail looks like: [PLACEHOLDER: link to example tx]. Notice the full signature chain."

**Reply 3 (Regulatory/Compliance):**
"We integrated KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) from day 1. Not an afterthought. This way, enterprises can deploy agents with compliance rigor already baked in. DM if you want to talk through compliance architecture."

**Reply 4 (Integration Complexity):**
"Fair point. We've optimized for this: one API, integrates Turnkey (wallets) + Lithic (fiat) + Persona (KYC) + Elliptic (AML) under one SDK. You don't manage five integrations; we do. TypeScript + Python SDKs ready to go."

**Reply 5 (Production Readiness):**
"Right now: testnet only. We're being intentional about compliance + auditing before mainnet. If you're building agents, you can test Sardis on testnet today. Real money in [PLACEHOLDER: H3 2026]. DM to chat timeline."

---

**Competitive/Positioning Replies:**

**Reply 6 (vs. Stripe):**
"Stripe is great for payments. But they're not built for agents executing autonomously. They require human approval flows. Sardis compiles policies to smart contracts, so agents can execute within rules without human gate. Different problem, different solution."

**Reply 7 (vs. Coinbase/x402):**
"x402 is the standard we're building on top of. Not against. Coinbase is implementing x402 for their infrastructure. Sardis implements x402 + adds policy enforcement + non-custodial architecture. We're complementary."

**Reply 8 (vs. Custodial Rails):**
"Custodial is simpler, I agree. But it shifts key risk to a third party. Non-custodial + policy enforcement gets you both: user control + trustworthy guardrails. Enterprise buyers will realize this is the stronger position."

**Reply 9 (Criticism: Too Complex):**
"The architecture is complex; the API is simple. You write policies in English. SDKs handle MPC + on-chain logic. Integration is not harder than Stripe. Give it a shot on testnet?"

**Reply 10 (Criticism: Another Crypto Payment Layer):**
"We're not a crypto payment layer; we're a payment OS for agents. Happens to use blockchain for auditability, not ideology. If enterprises need agents with financial authority, they need infrastructure that's trustworthy + auditable. That's us."

---

**Sales/Engagement Replies:**

**Reply 11 (Request for More Info):**
"Happy to dig deeper. Are you building agents now, or thinking about it? If you're further along, let's do a quick call. If earlier stage, I'd send you testnet access + SDK docs. Either way, DM?"

**Reply 12 (Founder/CEO Interested):**
"This is exactly the problem we're solving. Would love to chat about [PLACEHOLDER: their specific use case]. You building agents for [PLACEHOLDER: industry]? DM me—let's see if Sardis is a fit."

**Reply 13 (Engineer/Builder Interested):**
"If you want to tinker, testnet is live now. SDK is TypeScript + Python. We've got docs + a design partner cohort shipping agents. DM and I'll get you set up in 15 min."

**Reply 14 (VC/Investor Interested):**
"Thanks for the interest. I'm raising a seed round—[PLACEHOLDER: recent wins / design partner progress] showing early traction. Would love to chat. Are you focused on fintech infrastructure, or broader AI?"

**Reply 15 (Skeptical/Critical):**
"Fair point. You're right that [ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CRITICISM]. Here's how we're thinking about it: [SARDIS RESPONSE]. Would love your feedback—DM or I can send you testnet access to try it?"

---

**Network/Warm Intro Replies:**

**Reply 16 (Someone Tags You in Relevant Thread):**
"Thanks for the tag. [NAME], this is exactly what we're thinking about with Sardis. We're in testnet now with design partners. If you're exploring agent payments, would love to loop you in. DM?"

**Reply 17 (Retweet Engagement):**
"This resonates. One reason we built Sardis: [PLACEHOLDER: agreement + your angle]. The missing piece for enterprise adoption is trustworthy financial infrastructure for autonomous agents."

**Reply 18 (Direct Reply to Influential Account):**
"[INSIGHTFUL ADDITION TO THEIR POINT]. This is why Sardis matters. Agents can't get enterprise adoption without [POLICY ENFORCEMENT / NON-CUSTODIAL INFRASTRUCTURE]. Curious what you think about the approach."

**Reply 19 (Offer to Help):**
"Are you working on this? We're shipping design partner program now. If you need a non-custodial payment layer for agents, I'd be happy to help. No sales pitch, just genuine offer. DM?"

**Reply 20 (Build on Their Ideas):**
"You said [QUOTE THEIR KEY INSIGHT]. I'd add: [YOUR VALUE-ADD]. This is why non-custodial + policy-enforced infrastructure is a game-changer. If you're exploring this space, Sardis might be worth a look."

### r/artificial – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "How are you planning to handle payment authority for autonomous agents? Most AI payment solutions are custodial."

**Body:**
"I've been deep in this problem for a few months now, and I keep hitting the same wall: enterprises are willing to give agents read/execute access for a lot of workflows. But the moment money is involved, they panic. And rightfully so.

The current solutions:
1. **Custodial rails** (Stripe, Coinbase): Simple, but agent + your money both go through one company. Key risk lives somewhere.
2. **Build in-house**: Months of compliance work, hiring, audits. Not really scalable for early-stage companies.
3. **Don't let agents touch money**: Agents stay useful-but-dumb. Every financial decision requires human override.

I've been thinking about #3 as the real blocker. The second you add policy enforcement (e.g., 'agent can approve refunds under $500'), suddenly agents can move from chat to real transactions.

How are you all solving this? Building in-house? Using custodial? Or just avoiding financial authority altogether?

Edit: I work on payment infrastructure (shameless note), but I'm genuinely curious what's blocking adoption on your end. DM if you want to chat."

### r/artificial – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "What's the biggest blocker for agents executing financial transactions in your product/company?"

**Body:**
"I've talked to maybe 30 founders now who want to ship autonomous agents. Most hit the same wall: reasoning and tools are solved. But financial authority is a blocker.

Here's what I'm hearing:
- SaaS founders want agents to issue refunds, but don't know how to let them autonomously
- Trading teams want agents with hard-coded position limits, but don't trust centralized systems
- Procurement teams want agents that negotiate vendor terms, but want an audit trail

All of these come down to one problem: policy enforcement + auditability + non-custodial wallets. But the infrastructure doesn't exist yet.

So my question: are you running into this? And if so, how are you solving it?

(I'm building infrastructure to solve this, but I promise I'm asking because I genuinely want to understand your constraints. DM if you want to chat more.)"

### r/LocalLLaMA – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Running open-source agents locally? How do you handle transaction/payment workflows?"

**Body:**
"For folks running agents locally (OLlama, mistral, etc.), I'm curious: how are you thinking about workflows that require financial transactions?

Examples:
- Agent that coordinates customer support + issues refunds
- Agent that manages vendor negotiations + executes contracts
- Trading agent with position limits

Most cloud agent frameworks (AnthropicAPI, OpenAI agents) have no financial rails. LocalLLaMA community seems to care about autonomy + control, so this might be especially relevant.

If you've built something here, would love to learn. And if you're avoiding it because infrastructure doesn't exist, that's the problem we're thinking about too.

Hit me up if you want to chat."

---

### r/LocalLLaMA – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Guide: Building autonomous agents that handle money (without trusting a third party)"

**Body:**
"I've been helping some founders in the LocalLLaMA community integrate payment workflows into their agents. The pattern keeps coming up: you want your agent autonomous, but you don't want to give up key control.

Here's a rough architecture that works:
1. **Agent executes**: Agent decides on transaction (refund for customer, pay vendor, etc.)
2. **Policy check (off-chain)**: Your backend verifies: is this within policy? (Amount, time, recipient, etc.)
3. **MPC signature**: Actual transaction requires multiple signers (agent intent + policy check)
4. **On-chain execution**: Smart contract enforces the final gate

This way, your agent is autonomous, but transactions are policy-enforced and auditable.

Curious if this architecture maps to what you're building. If you're tackling this, DM and let's compare notes."

---

### r/LangChain – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "LangChain agents + payment workflows: what's the pattern you're using?"

**Body:**
"LangChain agents are great for tool composition, but I'm noticing the financial tools are pretty limited (most are read-only or sandbox).

If you're building autonomous workflows that touch payments (refunds, rebates, payments, contract execution), how are you thinking about:
1. **Authorization**: Who approves what?
2. **Auditability**: How do you log what happened?
3. **Non-custodial design**: How do you avoid key risk?

Would love to hear your patterns. Building this for a project? DM and let's chat."

---

### r/LangChain – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Extending LangChain agents with secure financial authority"

**Body:**
"For folks building LangChain agents that need financial capabilities, I put together a quick reference on how to integrate non-custodial payment flows.

The key insight: agents don't need wallet access. They need policy enforcement. The pattern:

1. Agent generates transaction intent (JSON)
2. Policy engine checks bounds
3. User/multi-sig approves
4. Transaction executes

This decouples agent autonomy from key custody.

If you're exploring this, happy to share details. DM?"

---

### r/ClaudeAI – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Using Claude agents to manage finances: how do we make it safe?"

**Body:**
"Claude's new agentic capabilities are wild. People are building autonomous systems. But the moment they touch money, enterprises get nervous.

I've been thinking about this: Claude agents can execute API calls. But what if some of those calls move money? How do you enforce guardrails?

Examples:
- Customer support agent that can issue refunds (under policy)
- Finance agent that can approve expenses (within budget)
- Vendor management agent that can execute contracts (within terms)

The pattern I keep coming back to: **natural language policies + non-custodial wallets**.

You write: 'This agent can approve refunds under $500, but only Mon-Fri.'
We compile to: smart contract + MPC signing rules.
Agent executes within policy. Everything auditable.

If you're playing with Claude agents, curious if this resonates. DM?"

---

### r/ClaudeAI – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "MCP Tools for Claude: Managing payments and financial authority safely"

**Body:**
"Building MCP tools for Claude agents? Here's a pattern that's working for financial tools:

Instead of giving agents direct key access, use MCP + policy enforcement:

1. Agent calls MCP tool: 'approve_refund(customer_id, amount)'
2. Tool checks policy: is this within bounds?
3. Tool requests signature: MPC + policy confirmation
4. Tool executes: transaction on-chain

This way, Claude agents are autonomous but policy-enforced.

We built 36 MCP tools for exactly this. If you're exploring, testnet is live. DM and I'll get you set up."

### r/startups – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Lessons from building payment infrastructure for autonomous agents (and why we're betting on non-custodial)"

**Body:**
"I've been heads-down on a specific problem for the last year: how do you let AI agents execute financial transactions safely?

Here are the lessons:

**1. Founders underestimate the custodial risk**
Every solution defaults to: agent needs a wallet → we hold the key. This is convenient but shifts risk to a third party. Enterprises hate this more than you'd think.

**2. Policy enforcement is the missing layer**
Once you separate policy-checking from custody, everything else gets simpler. Agent can be autonomous + policy-bounded + auditable.

**3. Compliance isn't optional, it's a feature**
KYC + AML from day 1. Not a roadmap item. This is what unlocks enterprise adoption.

**4. Open standards > lock-in**
Build on AP2/TAP/x402 (open payment protocols), not proprietary rails. Enterprises hate lock-in more than adoption friction.

**Tactical lesson**: If you're raising for fintech infra, lead with compliance + non-custodial. Those resonate with enterprise buyers way more than 'move money faster.'

Building Sardis (non-custodial payment OS for agents) based on these lessons. Happy to chat about any of this. DM?"

### r/startups – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "How to think about financial authority for autonomous agents (no, custodial isn't the answer)"

**Body:**
"A lot of founders are building autonomous agents. A lot of those founders will eventually want agents to execute financial transactions.

Here's the trap: default solution is custodial (agent has key, third party holds it).

Why this sucks:
- Shifts key risk to a third party (enterprises hate this)
- Creates compliance burden (you're responsible anyway)
- Builds lock-in (switching providers is hard)

Better model:
- Non-custodial (you keep the key)
- Policy-enforced (agent can only execute within bounds)
- Auditable (all transactions verifiable on-chain)

If you're thinking about this for your product, DM. Or check out what we're building: sardis.sh

The infrastructure for agent financial authority is being built right now. Better to understand it early than scramble when customers ask."

---

### r/fintech – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Non-custodial payment rails for autonomous agents: architecture + compliance thinking"

**Body:**
"Fintech builders, I want your thoughts on a specific problem:

Enterprises want to deploy autonomous agents that execute financial transactions. But they're unwilling to give agents (or any third party) direct key custody.

The infrastructure gap:
- Custodial solutions exist (Stripe, Coinbase, etc.) but shift key risk
- Non-custodial solutions don't exist (or didn't, until recently)

We're building Sardis around three principles:
1. **Non-custodial**: Agents execute from user wallets (MPC via Turnkey)
2. **Policy-enforced**: Natural language policies compile to smart contract rules
3. **Compliant**: KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) integrated from day 1

Technical questions:
- Does this architecture map to your compliance thinking?
- Are you seeing enterprise demand for this?
- Any major gaps you'd flag?

DM if you want to dig into this. Always interested in fintech infrastructure perspectives."

---

### r/fintech – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Regulatory perspective on non-custodial agent payments: what am I missing?"

**Body:**
"Fintech compliance folks: I'm thinking through the regulatory angle for autonomous agent payments, and I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Here's the model:
- Agent executes transaction intent
- Policy engine (off-chain) checks bounds
- Multi-sig gate (agent + policy check + user) approves
- Smart contract executes (on-chain)

From a compliance standpoint:
- No custody = no MSB license issues?
- Policy audit trail = stronger AML narrative?
- Open standards (AP2/TAP/x402) = more portable?

Curious what I'm missing. Are there regulatory vectors I should be thinking about?

(I'm building this, but I want to get it right. DM if you have thoughts.)"

---

### r/cryptocurrency – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Non-custodial vs. custodial: why the agent economy will demand non-custodial infrastructure"

**Body:**
"The next big wave in crypto isn't new tokens or DeFi primitives. It's agent payments infrastructure.

Here's why non-custodial wins:

**Custodial problem**: Enterprises want to deploy agents that move money. Giving agents (or a third party) key control is a liability nightmare. Regulatory risk, custody risk, operational risk.

**Non-custodial solution**: Agents execute transactions from user wallets. Policy enforcement lives in code (smart contracts). Auditability lives on-chain.

Why this matters:
- Enterprises trust this architecture way more
- Compliance is easier (policy = audit trail)
- No lock-in (policies portable across chains/providers)

The crypto community built the infrastructure for this: MPC, multi-sig, smart contracts. But the application layer (agent payment OS) doesn't exist yet.

Sardis is our bet on non-custodial. Curious what the community thinks.

DM or comment with thoughts."

---

### r/cryptocurrency – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "The case for non-custodial agent payments (and why it's good for crypto adoption)"

**Body:**
"Here's a hot take: crypto's killer app isn't DeFi, NFTs, or L2s. It's trustworthy agent payments infrastructure.

Why?
1. Agents need to execute transactions autonomously
2. Enterprises won't allow agents to custody keys or third parties to hold them
3. Smart contracts provide policy enforcement + auditability
4. Blockchains provide immutable audit trails

Current state: custodial payment rails (Stripe, Coinbase, etc.) don't solve the autonomy + trust problem.

Non-custodial model:
- Agents execute within policy
- Policies enforced in code
- Transactions auditable on-chain
- No third-party key custody

This is actually good for crypto adoption. Enterprise buyers realize: 'If I'm forced to use blockchain for auditability, blockchain is pretty good for this.'

Sardis is building this. Curious what crypto builders think about the approach.

DM?"

### r/SaaS – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Adding autonomous payment capabilities to your SaaS product — here's the architecture that actually works"

**Body:**
"If you're building a SaaS product with AI agents (support bots, workflow automation, etc.), you'll eventually hit this question: should the agent be able to spend money on behalf of users?

Examples:
- Customer support agent that issues refunds
- Procurement agent that reorders supplies
- Expense agent that approves team purchases

The naive approach: give the agent API keys to your payment processor. The problem: one hallucination and you're issuing $50k in refunds.

What actually works:
1. Separate the agent's 'intent' from the 'execution'
2. Insert a policy layer: 'refunds under $100 auto-approved, over $100 flagged'
3. Use non-custodial wallets so the agent can execute but never has full key access
4. Log everything to an immutable audit trail

This is the architecture we landed on after months of iteration. We call it policy-enforced financial authority.

If you're thinking about adding payment autonomy to your SaaS agents, happy to share what we learned. DM or comment."

---

### r/SaaS – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "The SaaS feature nobody's shipping yet: autonomous agent payments"

**Body:**
"Been talking to a lot of SaaS founders this month. Here's an interesting pattern:

Almost everyone is adding AI agents to their products. Support agents, onboarding agents, workflow agents.

But almost nobody is giving those agents financial authority. Why? Because the infrastructure doesn't exist.

Think about it:
- Your AI support agent can draft a refund response but can't actually issue the refund
- Your procurement agent can recommend a purchase but can't execute it
- Your expense bot can categorize spending but can't approve it

The missing piece is a policy-enforced payment layer. Something where you define rules ('refunds under $200, only for verified customers, max 10/day') and the agent operates within those bounds.

This is the next big SaaS feature unlock. The team that ships autonomous financial workflows first will have a massive competitive advantage.

We're building the infrastructure for this (Sardis — sardis.sh). But I'm more interested in hearing: are your customers asking for this? What use cases are you seeing?

DM if you want to dig into the architecture."

### r/Entrepreneur – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "I quit my job to build payment infrastructure for AI agents. Here's what I've learned in 6 months."

**Body:**
"Six months ago I was building internal tools at a fintech company. I gave an AI agent access to our cloud billing API and it 'optimized' our infrastructure — $3,000 overnight.

That's when I realized: AI agents are going to spend trillions of dollars. And there's literally no infrastructure designed for them.

So I quit and started building Sardis.

Here's what I've learned:

**1. The problem is real and urgent**
Every AI founder I talk to hits the same wall: 'My agent is smart enough to handle purchases, but I can't trust it with my credit card.' This isn't a nice-to-have — it's blocking real revenue.

**2. Non-custodial is the only architecture enterprises will accept**
Custodial solutions (where a third party holds your money) are a hard sell. 'You want me to give my agent's wallet to your startup?' doesn't fly. Non-custodial (you keep your keys, agent operates within policies) is the answer.

**3. Natural language policies are the UX breakthrough**
Instead of JSON configs or smart contract code, you write: 'Allow up to $100/day on SaaS tools, require approval over $50.' This is what gets non-technical stakeholders to say yes.

**4. Solo founding in fintech is hard but not impossible**
I built the entire stack solo — Python backend, TypeScript SDKs, Solidity smart contracts, React dashboard. The trick: use best-in-class providers (Turnkey for MPC, Persona for KYC, Lithic for cards) and compose them.

**5. Compliance from day 1 > compliance later**
I integrated KYC + AML before I had customers. Sounds backwards, but it's a massive selling point. 'We're compliant from day 1' is how you win enterprise conversations.

Currently in testnet with design partners. Happy to answer questions about fintech, solo founding, or the agent payments space.

sardis.sh if you want to check it out."

### r/Entrepreneur – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "The trillion-dollar infrastructure gap nobody's talking about: AI agents can't safely spend money"

**Body:**
"Quick thought experiment:

AI agents can now book flights, manage calendars, write code, and handle customer support. But ask any AI developer: 'Can your agent buy something?' The answer is almost always: 'Not safely.'

Why? Because current payment infrastructure was built for humans clicking buttons. Not for autonomous software making decisions.

The options today:
1. Give the agent your credit card (dangerous)
2. Approve every transaction manually (defeats the purpose)
3. Don't let agents spend money (limits their usefulness)

None of these scale.

What's needed: programmable wallets with policy enforcement. Think corporate expense policies, but enforced in real-time for AI agents.

Market size: $1.7 trillion in agent transactions by 2030 (per industry projections). Google, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard just announced the Agent Payment Protocol. OpenAI and Stripe are building Agentic Commerce Protocol.

The infrastructure layer between 'agent wants to buy something' and 'transaction executes safely' is the opportunity.

This is what I'm building (Sardis — sardis.sh). But I'm curious: for the entrepreneurs here, are you seeing AI agents in your industry that would benefit from payment autonomy?"

### r/ycombinator – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Show HN-style: Building a non-custodial payment OS for AI agents (solo founder, 6 months in)"

**Body:**
"Been lurking here for years. Finally have something worth sharing.

**What:** Sardis — payment infrastructure that lets AI agents execute transactions within human-defined policies.

**Why:** Every agent framework can reason and use tools. None of them can safely spend money. Custodial solutions exist but enterprises hate giving wallet control to third parties. We're non-custodial.

**How far along:**
- Full policy engine (natural language → enforced rules)
- MPC wallets via Turnkey (non-custodial)
- 36 MCP tools (works with Claude Desktop)
- KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) integrated
- Virtual cards (Lithic) for fiat
- Smart contracts deployed (Base Sepolia testnet)
- Python + TypeScript SDKs complete

**What I'm looking for:**
- Design partners building agent products (paid program, $1.5-2k/mo, testnet only)
- Technical feedback on the architecture
- Honest pushback on positioning

**Business model:** Transaction fees (0.25-0.75%) + SaaS tiers for policy engine.

**Solo founder note:** Built the entire stack solo. Actively looking for a technical co-founder (protocol/crypto background). 20-25% equity reserved.

### r/ycombinator – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Applying to YC S26 with agent payment infrastructure — how would you position this?"

**Body:**
"Working on my YC application and would love the community's honest take.

**The pitch:** Sardis is non-custodial payment infrastructure for AI agents. Natural language spending policies, MPC wallets, multi-chain settlement.

**The insight:** The biggest risk in AI isn't text hallucination — it's 'financial hallucination.' An agent executing a $5,000 purchase based on flawed logic. We built a policy firewall to prevent this.

**Where I'm stuck on the application:**

1. **'How far along are you?'** — Product is feature-complete on testnet. No production traffic yet. 3 alpha design partners. How honest should I be about the gap between 'built' and 'production'?

2. **'Solo founder'** — I built everything solo (15k+ lines, 3 smart contracts, full compliance stack). But I know YC prefers teams. I've reserved 20-25% for a co-founder. How do you frame 'looking for co-founder' without it sounding like a weakness?

3. **Market timing** — AP2, ACP, x402 are all emerging. Is 'the standards are being set right now' a strong 'why now' or does it sound like 'market is early'?

Genuine questions. Not fishing for validation — I want to submit the strongest possible application.

If any YC founders in fintech/infra have tips, I'm all ears."

### r/indiehackers – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Solo-founding a fintech startup: building payment infrastructure for AI agents"

**Body:**
"Hey indiehackers. I'm 6 months into building Sardis — payment infrastructure for AI agents.

Quick backstory: I was working at a fintech company, gave an AI agent access to our cloud billing, and it racked up $3k overnight. I realized nobody's built the 'guardrails' layer for agent spending. So I quit and started building.

**What I've built (solo):**
- Policy engine: write 'max $50/day on SaaS' and it enforces in real-time
- Non-custodial wallets (MPC) — I never hold customer funds
- Multi-chain settlement (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- KYC + AML compliance (Persona, Elliptic)
- Virtual cards for fiat payments (Lithic)
- MCP server for Claude Desktop (36 tools)
- Python + TypeScript SDKs

**Business model:**
- Transaction fees: 0.25-0.75% on volume
- SaaS tiers: $99-999/mo for policy engine features
- Design partner program: $1.5-2k/mo (testnet access)

**Where I am now:**
- Testnet live, looking for first design partners
- Pre-revenue (working on converting design partners to paid)
- Applying to accelerators (YC, PearX)

**What I've learned about solo-founding in fintech:**
1. Compose providers instead of building everything: Turnkey (wallets), Persona (KYC), Lithic (cards)
2. Compliance from day 1 is actually a competitive advantage
3. The 'agent payments' market is exploding — Google, PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase all launching protocols
4. Solo founding is lonely but you move insanely fast

Happy to answer questions about fintech, compliance, or building infra products solo.

### r/indiehackers – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "My first $0-to-design-partner journey: building in a brand new market (agent payments)"

**Body:**
"Posting here because I want to be transparent about the journey.

I'm building Sardis — payment infrastructure for AI agents. 6 months in, zero revenue, but I think the market is about to explode.

**The market signal:** Google + 60 partners announced AP2 (Agent Payment Protocol). OpenAI + Stripe announced ACP. Coinbase launched x402. When every major player is building the same thing, the market is real.

**My bet:** The policy/trust layer is the winner-take-most opportunity. Anyone can build payment rails. The hard part is: how do you let agents spend money safely?

**Current status:**
- Full product built (solo)
- Testnet live
- 3 alpha testers giving feedback
- Looking for 8-12 paid design partners ($1.5-2k/mo)

**The honest challenge:** I'm a solo founder in Istanbul trying to sell enterprise infrastructure to US companies. The timezone gap, the lack of local network, and the solo-founder stigma are all real obstacles.

**What's working:**
- Building in public on X (slowly growing audience)
- Reddit (this kind of post)
- Cold email with actual personalization (not spray-and-pray)

**What's not working:**
- Generic outreach gets ignored
- LinkedIn is slow for me
- Conferences are expensive and I'm bootstrapping

If you're also building in a new/emerging market, would love to compare notes. Or if you're building AI agents and need payment capabilities, let's talk.

DM open."

### r/MicroSaaS – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Adding payment autonomy to your micro-SaaS: the feature that unlocks $$$"

**Body:**
"If you're building a micro-SaaS with AI features, here's a feature idea that most people are sleeping on: **letting your AI agent make purchases on behalf of users.**

Examples:
- Social media tool: agent automatically buys ad credits when performance dips
- Dev tool: agent auto-scales cloud resources and pays for the upgrade
- Research tool: agent purchases data from paid APIs when free sources are exhausted
- Support tool: agent issues refunds within pre-approved limits

The reason nobody ships this: there's no easy way to give an agent 'financial authority' with guardrails.

What I mean by guardrails:
- 'Max $20/day'
- 'Only for these specific services'
- 'Require user approval over $50'
- 'Full audit trail'

We built Sardis to solve this. Non-custodial payment OS for agents. You embed our SDK, define policies in plain English, and your agent can transact within bounds.

If you're a micro-SaaS builder thinking about this, I'd love to chat about your use case. We're in testnet looking for design partners.

DM or comment."

---

### r/MicroSaaS – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Infrastructure idea: payment APIs designed for AI agents, not humans"

**Body:**
"All current payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) were built for human-initiated flows: user clicks button → checkout page → confirmation.

But what about AI agents? They don't click buttons. They make decisions programmatically. And they need different primitives:

Instead of checkout flows, they need:
- **Policy enforcement**: 'max $X per transaction, only approved categories'
- **Autonomous execution**: transact without human in the loop (within policy bounds)
- **Audit trail**: why did the agent decide to spend this money?
- **Non-custodial wallets**: agent has a wallet, but user keeps the keys

This is a new infrastructure category. Agent-native payments.

I'm building this (Sardis). The bet: as AI agents get embedded in every SaaS product, the payment layer for agents becomes critical infrastructure.

For micro-SaaS builders: would you embed something like this? What features would matter most?"

### r/SideProject – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "My side project turned full-time: building payment infrastructure for AI agents (demo inside)"

**Body:**
"Started this as a side project after my AI agent racked up a $3k cloud bill overnight. Now it's my full-time thing.

**What it does:** Sardis gives AI agents their own wallets with spending policies. You write rules in plain English ('max $50/day, only approved vendors'), and the agent can transact within those bounds. Everything logged, nothing custodial.

**Tech stack:**
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Smart contracts: Solidity + Foundry
- SDKs: Python + TypeScript
- MPC wallets: Turnkey
- Cards: Lithic
- KYC: Persona
- AML: Elliptic

**Demo:** sardis.sh (testnet is live — you can create a wallet and test policies)

**Looking for:** Feedback from builders. If you're working on anything with AI agents, I'd love to hear:
1. Would your agents benefit from payment capabilities?
2. What policies would you want?
3. Any obvious gaps in the approach?

Be brutal. I'd rather hear hard truths now than after launch."

### r/SideProject – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "6 months building a payment OS for AI agents — here's a walkthrough"

**Body:**
"After 6 months of building, I want to show what I've got and get honest feedback.

**Sardis** = payment infrastructure for AI agents. The idea: agents get wallets with policy enforcement. They can spend money autonomously, but only within rules you define.

**What I've built:**
- Natural language policy engine ('max $100/day on cloud services')
- Non-custodial MPC wallets (you keep your keys)
- Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)
- Virtual cards for fiat payments
- 36 MCP tools for Claude Desktop
- Full compliance stack (KYC + AML)

**What I haven't built yet:**
- Production mainnet deployment (testnet only)
- Paying customers (looking for design partners)
- A team (solo founder, looking for co-founder)

Testnet is live at sardis.sh. Would love feedback on the product, positioning, or anything else.

What would you build with this?"

### r/RoastMyStartup – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Roast my startup: Sardis — payment OS for AI agents"

**Body:**
"Alright, roast me.

**What:** Sardis — non-custodial payment infrastructure for AI agents.

**The pitch:** AI agents can reason but can't safely spend money. We're the policy layer between agents and payments.

**How it works:**
1. Agent gets a wallet (MPC, non-custodial)
2. You define spending policies in plain English
3. Agent transacts within those bounds
4. Everything logged to immutable audit trail

**Where I am:**
- Solo founder, 6 months in
- Full product built (testnet)
- Zero revenue, zero customers (looking for design partners)
- Based in Istanbul, targeting US market

**What I think is strong:**
- Non-custodial architecture (only player doing this)
- Natural language policies (nobody else has this)
- Full compliance stack from day 1
- Protocol-native (AP2/TAP/x402)

**What I think is weak:**
- Solo founder in fintech
- No production traffic yet
- Based outside the US
- Brand new market (could be too early)

I quit my job 6 months ago to build payment infrastructure specifically for AI agents. The thesis: agents will spend trillions of dollars, and they need guardrails.

**Product:** Non-custodial wallets + natural language spending policies + compliance (KYC/AML) + multi-chain settlement.

**Business model:** Transaction fees (0.25-0.75%) + SaaS for policy features ($99-999/mo).

**The bull case:** Google, PayPal, Visa, Stripe, Coinbase are all building agent payment protocols. The market is clearly forming. We're the only non-custodial, compliance-first player.

**The bear case:** Maybe agents won't actually need to spend money for another 3-5 years. Maybe Stripe just adds an 'agent mode.' Maybe nobody wants to pay $2k/mo for testnet access.

**My honest assessment:**
- Built the product? Yes.
- Found product-market fit? Not yet.
- Have revenue? No.
- Have customers? 3 alpha testers (unpaid).
- Running out of money? Not yet, but solo founder in Istanbul isn't cheap forever.

Roast away. I need to know if I should keep going or pivot."

### r/Business_Ideas – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "Business idea validation: payment infrastructure for the AI agent economy"

**Body:**
"Want to share a business idea and get the community's take.

**The opportunity:** AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) are getting good enough to handle complex tasks. But they can't safely spend money. There's no 'Stripe for bots.'

**The gap:** Current payment infrastructure was built for humans. Agents need different things: spending policies, autonomous execution, audit trails, non-custodial wallets.

**The market signals:**
- Google + 60 partners launched Agent Payment Protocol
- OpenAI + Stripe launched Agentic Commerce Protocol
- Coinbase launched x402 for agent micropayments
- Transaction volume through agents grew 35,000% recently

**The business model:**
- Transaction fees (0.25-0.75% on volume)
- SaaS subscriptions ($99-999/mo for policy engine)
- Enterprise contracts for custom compliance

**My progress:** I've been building this for 6 months (Sardis — sardis.sh). Full product on testnet. Looking for design partners.

**Questions for this community:**
1. Does the market opportunity sound real?
2. Would you use something like this if you were building an AI product?
3. Any business model concerns?

Not trying to sell anything — genuinely want to validate the idea."

### r/Business_Ideas – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "The 'picks and shovels' play for the AI agent gold rush: payment infrastructure"

**Body:**
"Everyone's talking about AI agents. Here's the infrastructure opportunity nobody's discussing:

AI agents will need to spend money. A lot of money. Projections say $1.7 trillion by 2030.

But right now? Giving an agent a credit card is like giving a toddler car keys. They might get somewhere, they might cause damage.

**The opportunity:** Build the 'policy layer' between AI agents and money. Think corporate expense policies, but automated and enforced in real-time.

**Why this is a good business:**
- Transaction fees = recurring revenue tied to volume
- Every agent needs it = huge addressable market
- Compliance requirements = moat (not easy to replicate KYC/AML + policy engine)
- Non-custodial = lower regulatory burden than holding customer funds

**Who the customer is:**
- SaaS companies adding AI agents to their products
- Enterprises deploying internal AI assistants
- AI-native startups building autonomous workflows

**What it takes to build:**
- Deep fintech + crypto knowledge
- Compliance stack (KYC, AML, sanctions screening)
- Multi-chain settlement infrastructure
- Policy engine that parses natural language into enforced rules

I'm building this. 6 months in. Full product on testnet. The question is whether the timing is right or 2 years too early.

Thoughts?"

**Title:** "How I'm acquiring first design partners for a B2B fintech product (step by step)"

**Body:**
"Building a payment infrastructure product for AI agents (Sardis). Currently in testnet, trying to land 8-12 paid design partners at $1.5-2k/month.

Here's my exact playbook:

**Target:** Companies building AI agents that need payment capabilities.

**Channels (ranked by expected ROI):**
1. Cold email with deep personalization (scrape website → generate personalized email with LLM)
2. X/Twitter threads on agent payments (educational, not salesy)
3. Reddit posts in relevant communities (value-first, mention product only at the end)
4. Warm intros from founder network

**Cold email approach:**
- Use Firecrawl to scrape prospect's website
- Feed into Claude API to generate 4-sentence personalized email
- Reference something specific about their product
- Connect it to a problem Sardis solves
- Send from personal email, not marketing tool

**Results so far (2 weeks in):**
- 40 cold emails sent
- 12 replies (30% response rate)
- 5 discovery calls booked
- 2 verbal commitments (not yet signed)

**What's working:**
- Deep personalization (mentioning their specific product features)
- 'I noticed X about your product' opener
- Short emails (4 sentences max)
- Following up exactly 2 days later

**What's not working:**
- Generic 'AI agents need payments' messaging
- Long emails with full product descriptions
- LinkedIn InMail (0% response rate so far)

Will update as I close the first partners. Questions welcome."

### r/growmybusiness – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Solo founder growth tactics for a B2B infrastructure product (30 min/day budget)"

**Body:**
"I'm a solo founder with 30-60 minutes per day for marketing. Building payment infrastructure for AI agents (sardis.sh).

Here's what I've tested and what works when you're bandwidth-constrained:

**The 30-minute daily routine:**
- 10 min: Send 3-5 personalized cold emails (pre-researched batch)
- 10 min: Post 1 piece of content (X thread or Reddit post)
- 10 min: Reply to inbound messages + engage with community

**What moves the needle:**
1. Cold email with LLM personalization (highest ROI per minute)
2. Reddit posts that lead with genuine value
3. X threads that educate first, mention product last

**What wastes time:**
1. LinkedIn content (too slow for early-stage)
2. Trying to go viral (focus on qualified conversations)
3. Building perfect landing pages (iterate after traffic)

**Key metric:** Qualified conversations per week. Target: 5. Currently hitting: 3-4.

If you're also a solo founder doing growth on limited time, what's your daily routine?"

**Title:** "From $3k cloud bill to building payment infrastructure for AI agents — the full story"

**Body:**
"Every founder has an 'aha' moment. Mine was a $3,000 cloud bill.

I was building internal tools at a fintech company. Gave an AI agent access to our cloud billing API so it could auto-scale resources. The agent decided to 'optimize performance' by spinning up GPU instances across three regions.

$3,000. In one night.

That's when it clicked: AI agents are going to spend trillions of dollars. And there's literally no guardrails.

**What I did next:**
1. Researched every payment solution (Stripe, Coinbase, etc.) — none designed for agents
2. Quit my job (October 2025)
3. Started building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents

**What I've built in 6 months (solo):**
- Full policy engine (write rules in English, enforced in real-time)
- Non-custodial MPC wallets (user keeps keys)
- Multi-chain settlement
- Virtual cards for fiat
- KYC + AML compliance
- SDKs for Python + TypeScript

**Where I am now:**
- Testnet live
- Looking for design partners ($1.5-2k/month, testnet only)
- Applying to accelerators (YC, PearX)
- Self-funded, based in Istanbul

**The honest truth:** I'm 6 months in with zero revenue. But Google, PayPal, Visa, Stripe, and Coinbase are all building agent payment protocols. The market is coming. I'm trying to be ready.

Will keep updating this thread. Roast me, encourage me, or just lurk. All welcome.

### r/smallbusiness – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "AI is about to change how small businesses handle payments — here's what to watch for"

**Body:**
"If you run a small business and you're starting to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), there's a shift coming that'll directly affect your operations.

**The trend:** AI agents (not just chatbots — actual autonomous software) are starting to handle tasks like:
- Customer support with refund authority
- Inventory reordering when stock is low
- Expense approval and categorization
- Subscription management and renewals

**The problem:** Right now, giving an AI tool access to your business payments is risky. There's no way to say 'you can spend up to $100 on supplies, but nothing else.'

**What's changing:**
New infrastructure is being built specifically for this. Companies like Google, PayPal, and Visa are developing protocols for AI agent payments. The idea: AI gets its own 'expense account' with rules you define.

**What this means for small businesses:**
- Eventually, your AI assistant will be able to reorder supplies, pay invoices, and manage subscriptions — all within limits you set
- You'll define rules like 'max $200/week on office supplies, require my approval for anything over $100'
- Full audit trail so you can see exactly what the AI spent and why

**My take:** This is 12-18 months away from being mainstream. But the infrastructure is being built right now.

I'm building in this space (Sardis — sardis.sh). Curious: for small business owners here, what tasks would you want an AI agent to handle financially? What would make you trust it?"

---

### r/smallbusiness – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Would you let an AI handle your business expenses if it had strict spending limits?"

**Body:**
"Genuine question for small business owners:

AI tools are getting really good at tasks like customer support, scheduling, and research. But most of them can't actually handle money.

Imagine if your AI assistant could:
- Reorder office supplies when you're running low (within a budget you set)
- Process customer refunds under $50 automatically
- Pay recurring invoices on time
- Buy ad credits when your campaign budget allows it

But with strict rules:
- 'Max $100/day total'
- 'Only from approved vendors'
- 'Anything over $50 needs my approval'
- 'No subscriptions without my okay'

And you get a full log of everything it spent and why.

Would you use something like this?

I ask because I'm building payment infrastructure for AI agents (sardis.sh) and I want to understand if small business owners see value in this, or if it's too 'futuristic' right now.

Honest feedback appreciated."

---

### r/business – VARIANT 1

**Title:** "The next big shift in business payments: AI agents with financial authority"

**Body:**
"A trend worth watching: AI agents are moving from 'assistants that chat' to 'autonomous workers that transact.'

The evidence:
- Google + 60 partners (PayPal, Visa, Mastercard) launched the Agent Payment Protocol
- OpenAI + Stripe launched Agentic Commerce Protocol
- Coinbase launched x402 for machine-to-machine payments
- AI agent transaction volume grew 35,000% in Q4 2025

What this means for businesses:
1. AI agents will increasingly handle procurement, expense management, and payments
2. Companies will need 'spending policies' for their AI — like expense policies for employees
3. Audit trails for AI spending will become a compliance requirement
4. The infrastructure companies that enable safe AI payments will be the next Stripe/PayPal

The challenge: how do you let AI make financial decisions without losing control? The answer: programmable wallets with policy enforcement.

I'm building in this space (Sardis — sardis.sh). But regardless of my company, this trend is real and accelerating. Worth having on your radar."

---

### r/business – VARIANT 2

**Title:** "Why 'financial hallucination' is the next big risk for businesses using AI"

**Body:**
"We talk a lot about AI hallucination in text — chatbots making things up, giving wrong information.

But there's a bigger risk emerging: **financial hallucination.** An AI agent executing a transaction based on flawed logic.

Examples that have already happened:
- An AI agent 'optimized costs' by upgrading a company to enterprise-tier everything ($3k overnight)
- A booking agent found 'great deals' and booked 6 flights nobody needed
- A research agent bought premium data subscriptions on 14 different platforms — recurring monthly

As AI agents get more autonomy, financial hallucination becomes a real business risk. Especially as companies start letting agents handle procurement, expense approval, and vendor payments.

The solution: policy-enforced financial authority. Instead of giving AI full payment access, you define rules:
- 'Max $500/day'
- 'Only approved vendors'
- 'Require human approval above $200'
- 'Full audit trail'

The infrastructure for this is being built right now. It's the 'expense policy' equivalent for AI workers.

I'm building in this space (sardis.sh). But the broader point: if your business is deploying AI agents, you need to start thinking about financial guardrails. It's not a nice-to-have — it's risk management."

"Hi [NAME],

I've been following [COMPANY] for a bit—your [SPECIFIC PRODUCT/FEATURE] is impressive.

I'm building Sardis (non-custodial payment OS for agents), and I'm noticing a pattern: SaaS teams like you are building autonomous agents, but they stop at transactions. Why? No trustworthy way to let agents move money.

This is a blocker for [THEIR INDUSTRY]. Example: customer success agents that can issue refunds autonomously, within policy.

**TOUCH 2: Credibility + Specificity (Day 3, 2pm ET)**

Subject: Re: Agents + transactions (Sardis) — one thing I noticed

Body:

"Hi [NAME],

Quick follow-up. I was looking at your [SPECIFIC FEATURE/ANNOUNCEMENT], and one thing jumped out:

You're shipping agents + you're handling [RELEVANT TRANSACTION TYPE]. That's exactly where policy-enforced payments matter.

Here's what we see: most teams build agents with read-only rules first, then realize autonomous transactions are a separate problem (custody risk, audit trail, policy enforcement).

We've solved that. Non-custodial, natural language policies, protocol-native.

If you want to see the architecture, I can share a 5-min demo. Or if this isn't a priority now, no worries—happy to loop back when it is.

Cheers,

### 5 Investor Cold Emails (FULL DRAFTS)

**EMAIL 1: VC with AI + Fintech Thesis (Khosla, Spark, etc.)**

Subject: AI agent payments (non-custodial infrastructure)

Body:

"Hi [VC_PARTNER_NAME],

I'm Efe, building Sardis—the non-custodial payment OS for AI agents.

Quick context: agents are becoming economically viable for enterprise workflows. But they won't get financial authority without guardrails. We've built the guardrails (policy enforcement + MPC + compliance), and it turns out enterprises prefer non-custodial architecture (key risk reduction).

Current state:
- 15+ design partners on testnet
- Integrated KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic)
- Full AP2/TAP/x402 compliance
- Founder: solo, Istanbul-based, deep crypto/fintech background

We're raising seed round for: eng hiring + design partner expansion + compliance audit.

Target: $500k-1M seed.

Are you interested in AI agent infrastructure plays? If so, would love a 20-min call.

Cheers,

**EMAIL 2: VC with Enterprise/B2B Thesis**

Subject: Autonomous agents for enterprise (policy-enforced transactions)

Body:

"Hi [VC_PARTNER_NAME],

I'm building Sardis (enterprise-grade payment OS for autonomous agents).

Here's the problem: SaaS teams are adding AI agents to their products. But agents stop at transactions (refunds, rebates, payments). Why? No safe way to let agents move money.

Sardis solves it: natural language policies + non-custodial wallets + compliance integrated. One API.

Design partner cohort includes [COMPANY TYPE EXAMPLES: customer success SaaS, marketplace operators, fintech platforms]. Consistent feedback: 'This is what we've been waiting for.'

We're raising seed to expand cohort + ship mainnet.

Are you looking at AI agent infrastructure? Let's chat.

**EMAIL 3: Angel / Earlier-Stage Focus**

Subject: Agent payments (design partner traction)

Body:

"Hi [ANGEL_NAME],

Quick note: I'm Efe, building Sardis (non-custodial payments for autonomous agents).

Seeing strong signal from design partners. Pattern emerging: once agents can move money safely, adoption accelerates.

We're in testnet + raising seed round. Looking for investors who understand both AI infrastructure + compliance complexity.

Would you be open to a quick call? I'd love your perspective on the space.

**EMAIL 4: Corporate VC / Strategic Play**

Subject: Partnership exploration (agent payment layer)

Body:

"Hi [CORPORATE_VC_PARTNER],

I'm building Sardis (non-custodial payment infrastructure for AI agents).

[COMPANY]'s move into [THEIR_AI_INITIATIVE] is interesting. I think there's a strategic angle: [COMPANY] agents need payment authority. Sardis could be the infrastructure layer.

Two ways to think about it:
1. Strategic investment + integration
2. Straight-up investment

Either way, would [COMPANY] be interested in learning more?

Happy to set up a call with your team.

**EMAIL 5: Founder-Led Fund / Angels**

Subject: YC W26 founder (agent payments)

Body:

"Hi [FOUNDER_NAME],

Fellow [PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE] here, now building Sardis (non-custodial payments for AI agents).

The problem: agents can reason autonomously now, but enterprises won't trust them with money. We've built the solution (policy-enforced, auditable, non-custodial).

Raising seed ($500k-1M) to expand design partner cohort + add eng capacity.

You've been through this before—would love your perspective on product market fit signals + fundraising strategy.

## SECTION 10: ASSETS TO PREPARE

### 1-Page Design Partner Brief (FULL DRAFT)

---

**SARDIS DESIGN PARTNER BRIEF**

**What is Sardis?**
Non-custodial payment operating system for AI agents. Your agents execute transactions from your own wallets, with policies enforced in code. Everything auditable on-chain.

**Why Design Partners?**
We're pre-mainnet. We need to learn from teams building real agents, in real industries, with real constraints.

**The Offer:**
- **Duration**: 3 months (month-to-month, no long-term lock-in)
- **Cost**: $1,500/month (Starter) or $2,000/month (Pro)
- **Access**: Testnet environment, policy engine, multi-chain support
- **Support**: Weekly sync with founder, async Slack, integration help
- **Limits**: Testnet only, no production traffic, no SLA

**What's Included:**

| | Starter ($1.5k/mo) | Pro ($2k/mo) |
|---|---|---|
| Testnet access | ✓ | ✓ |
| Policy engine | ✓ | ✓ |
| Multi-chain testing | ✓ | ✓ |
| Weekly sync | ✓ | ✓ |
| Slack support | ✓ | ✓ |
| Lithic integration | | ✓ |
| Priority feature requests | | ✓ |
| Monthly business review | | ✓ |

**Your Commitment:**
- Dedicated technical POC (engineer or founder)
- 1 hour/week feedback loop
- 1+ autonomous agent shipped on testnet
- Permission to share learnings (case study, testimonial optional)

**Success Criteria:**
- You: Ship 1+ agents using Sardis policies
- You: 5+ successful test transactions
- Sardis: Qualified feedback loop (2+ design reviews)
- Sardis: Permission to reference in case studies

**How to Apply:**
DM me (@EfeDurmaz or sardis.sh).

Tell me:
1. What agents are you building?
2. When do you need financial authority?
3. Are you ready to commit 1h/week feedback?

That's it. No sales call required first.

**FAQ:**

Q: What if we don't like it?
A: 30-day cancellation, no questions asked.

Q: Will there be production traffic?
A: Testnet only. Mainnet comes Q3 2026.

Q: Can you promise uptime?
A: No SLA. Testnet is "best effort." But we've architected for graceful degradation (policies live on-chain).

Q: What if you pivot to custodial later?
A: We won't. We're protocol-first. Open-sourcing the MPC + policy engine within 2 years (committed in writing).

### Demo Narrative (2-3 Min Script)

**Script:**

"Here's what Sardis does in practice.

Let's say you're a SaaS company with a customer success agent. The agent should be able to issue refunds, but only under these conditions: under $500, only to paying customers, never more than 3x per month per customer.

In Sardis, you write that policy in English. It compiles to smart contract rules.

[SHOW: Policy in English → Compiled to smart contract]

Now, when the agent decides to issue a refund, it sends a transaction request. The request hits our policy engine. The engine checks: is this within the bounds? If yes, it requests a signature.

[SHOW: Agent request → Policy check → MPC signature gate]

The signature is split across multiple signers (agent intent + policy check + user approval). Once you hit threshold, the transaction executes on-chain.

[SHOW: On-chain transaction]

Here's the key part: everything is auditable. You can verify on-chain that every transaction followed policy. No trust required; verify me.

And because it's non-custodial, your agent never touches the key. You keep full control.

That's Sardis. Autonomous agents, policy-enforced, non-custodial, auditable."

---

### FAQ Sheet (Risk / Compliance / Production Readiness)

**Q: What if your service goes down?**
A: Sardis can go offline; policies can't. Policies live on-chain. Agents fetch policies at transaction time. If Sardis is down, agents still execute within stored policy. We've designed for graceful degradation.

**Q: How do you ensure compliance?**
A: KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) integrated from day 1. Not an afterthought. Every transaction includes compliance checks. Audit trail is on-chain.

**Q: What if regulators say this isn't compliant?**
A: We're monitoring EU AI Act, SEC guidance, and fintech regulations closely. Policies are more conservative than existing regs. If anything, we de-risk your liability by creating an immutable audit trail. We stay in conversation with regulators.

**Q: Is this safe for production?**
A: Not yet. We're testnet-only until Q3 2026. We're doing a security audit before mainnet launch. Don't put real money in until then.

**Q: What if you pivot the business model?**
A: We won't. We've committed (in writing, in the program terms) to keep non-custodial architecture. We're also planning to open-source the MPC + policy engine within 2 years. You're not locked in.

**Q: Can you scale this to high throughput?**
A: Testnet can handle 100-1000 TPS (depending on chain). Mainnet will be higher. We're optimizing for smart contract efficiency + multi-chain routing. Ask us during design partner calls for specific benchmarks.

**Q: What if we want to move to another provider?**
A: Policies are portable. Since we're building on open standards (AP2/TAP/x402), you can migrate to another provider (if one existed) without re-writing policies.

**Q: What happens to our data after the 3-month pilot?**
A: Testnet transactions are public on-chain anyway. We keep design partner metadata (company name, contact, feedback) until you ask us to delete. You own your data; we're not selling it.

**Q: Can you help us integrate with [THEIR_BACKEND]?**
A: If it's a standard (API, SDK, webhook), yes. Custom integration is out of scope for design partner program. We provide SDK + docs; you own integration.

### Clear Stop/Iterate Rules Per Channel

**X (Twitter):**
- **Stop if**: < 1% reply rate on threads after 24h (means poor reply-baiting copy)
- **Iterate if**: High impressions (3k+) but low replies; adjust thread structure (shorter, more question-driven)
- **Double down if**: Any thread hits 200+ replies; create 2-3 more variations

**Reddit:**
- **Stop if**: Downvoted below 0 or removed by mods (bad fit); don't post to that subreddit again
- **Iterate if**: Post gets 50-100 upvotes but low DMs; improve call-to-action or DM template
- **Double down if**: Post hits 200+ upvotes; follow up in comments with related insights

**Cold Email:**
- **Stop if**: < 2% reply rate on a 20-email batch; rework subject lines + copy
- **Iterate if**: 2-5% reply rate; gradually increase volume, keep copy
- **Double down if**: > 5% reply rate; scale to 50-email batch size

**Investor Outreach:**
- **Stop if**: No meetings after 15 cold emails; switch to warm intro path only
- **Iterate if**: Getting meetings but no follow-up interest; refine investor targeting or pitch
- **Double down if**: Any investor shows strong interest; prioritize relationship building with their fund

## ALL 3 X THREADS (READY TO POST)

### THREAD 1: FOUNDER STORY

```
I've been thinking about AI agents for 2 years. Everyone talks about reasoning. Nobody talks about transactions.

Here's the problem I couldn't unsee: agents can think at superhuman scale. But enterprises won't let them touch money.

Not because they can't code a payment. Because they can't sleep at night.

---

The current options are terrible:
- Custodial rails (Stripe, Coinbase): agent has key, you lose control
- In-house compliance: 6-month slog, 100k+ engineering
- Don't let agents do anything financial: agents stay dumb, useful only for chat

There's no middle ground.

---

So I started Sardis: the non-custodial payment OS for agents.

Your agent executes transactions from your own wallet. Sardis enforces policy in code ('approve refunds under $500, never on Mondays'). Everything auditable on-chain.

The agent earns trust through guardrails, not gatekeeping.

---

Why this matters:

SaaS companies could ship autonomous refund agents.
Trading firms could deploy agents with hard-coded position limits.
Procurement teams could let agents negotiate vendor terms, then execute within budget.

But first: guardrails. Policy. Auditability.

---

We've built Sardis with:
- Non-custodial MPC wallets (Turnkey)
- Natural language policy engine (English → smart contract)
- Full AP2/TAP/x402 protocol compliance
- Integrated compliance: KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic)
- Multi-chain: Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism

Design partner cohort is live now.

---

If your company is building agents that need financial authority, let's talk. DM me or visit sardis.sh

We're looking for 5-10 testnet design partners this quarter. You get early access + direct feedback loop with the team.

---

This is testnet only. Real money won't move through Sardis until Q3 2026. We're being intentional about compliance from day 1.

But the time to build agent financial infrastructure is now. Before the market assumes custodial is the only way.

---

Thoughts? What am I missing? How do you think about agent financial authority?

RT, reply, or DM. I read every response.
```

### THREAD 2: TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE

```
Let me explain the Sardis architecture in technical detail. If you're building payment infrastructure, this might matter to you.

The core insight: policy ≠ custody.

---

Most payment systems conflate two things:
1. **Policy enforcement** (rules: can't exceed $500, needs approval)
2. **Custody** (holding the key)

Stripe bundles them: you trust Stripe, they enforce policy.
We decouple them: you hold the key, smart contracts enforce policy.

Why? Non-custodial.

---

Architecture:

Agent → Sardis SDK → Policy engine (off-chain) → MPC threshold (Turnkey) → Policy contract (on-chain) → Wallet execution

If Sardis goes down, agent still executes within stored policy. Graceful degradation.

---

Non-custodial MPC via Turnkey:

Agent never knows the full key. Sardis never holds the key. Key is split across threshold signers. To move money, you need:
- Agent signature (intent)
- Sardis signature (policy check: did you stay within limits?)
- User approval (veto gate)

3-of-3 multisig abstracted away.

---

Natural language policies compile to smart contract rules.

English: 'Approve refunds up to $500, but not on weekends, and require approval if > $200'

Compiles to: timelock, approval gate, amount check, day-of-week oracle. All on-chain.

---

Protocol compliance: AP2 (Abstract Payment Protocol), TAP (Transaction Authorization Protocol), x402 (Billable APIs).

We're not building a silo. We're implementing open standards. Agents can port policies between payment systems.

---

Multi-chain architecture:

Base (primary, cheap), Polygon (backup), Ethereum (high-value), Arbitrum/Optimism (scaling). Policies are chain-agnostic; agents pick best route based on asset + speed.

No lock-in to one L2.

---

SDKs: Python + TypeScript. MCP server with 36 tools for Claude Desktop integration.

If you're an agent, you talk to Sardis via JSON-RPC. If you're a human, you interact via MCP or UI.

Open standards, multiple interfaces.
```

### THREAD 3: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

```
Everyone's building agent payment rails right now. Let me unpack what's different about the approaches:

Custodial (Skyfire, Payman): Stripe for agents. Fast. Trusted. But you give up key control.
Non-custodial (Sardis, Nevermined): You keep the key. Policy enforced in code.

Pick your tradeoff.

---

Custodial pros:
- Simpler UX (one company handles everything)
- Established compliance framework
- Clear liability line (custody provider = liable)

Custodial cons:
- Key risk (another company holds your money)
- Compliance burden falls on you anyway
- Lock-in to one provider's rules

---

Non-custodial pros:
- You keep the key (zero key risk)
- Policies auditable on-chain (can't be changed without your consent)
- Multi-chain + multi-provider (pick your backend)

Non-custodial cons:
- Slightly more complex integration
- Fewer established compliance playbooks (we're filling this gap)
- Requires self-custody discipline

---

Take: The enterprise buyer will want both. Non-custodial architecture + integrated compliance (KYC + AML).

That's where Sardis sits. You get user control + policy enforcement + compliance guardrails. No custodial risk, no compliance gap.

---

If you're an enterprise building agents, the question isn't 'custodial or non-custodial?' It's 'do I want to sleep at night knowing my agent transactions are auditable, policy-enforced, and not held by a third party?'

Our answer: Sardis.
```

## ALL 10 SHORT X POSTS (READY TO PASTE)

1. "Your AI agent can reason at superhuman scale now. But enterprises won't give it financial authority without guardrails. That's why Sardis exists. Non-custodial. Policy-enforced. Auditable. Testnet design partners: dm for access."

2. "The payment stack for AI agents doesn't exist yet. Stripe wasn't built for autonomous transactions. Coinbase wasn't built for policy enforcement. We're building what's missing: sardis.sh"

3. "Natural language policies for agent spending: 'This agent can approve refunds under $500, but only Mon-Fri, and only if approval_count < 3' Compiles to smart contract rules. Auditable on-chain. No custom smart contract code needed."

4. "Design partners: we're looking for 5-10 SaaS / agent framework companies to test Sardis testnet. You get early access, direct feedback loop with the team, and case study opportunity. $1.5k-$2k/month. 3-month commitment. DM if interested."

5. "Why non-custodial for agents? Because if your agent has a key, someone has to hold it. If Sardis holds it, we're a target. If you hold it, you sleep better. We enforce policy in code, not in custody."

6. "The agent economy won't scale without: 1) Reasoning (LLMs solved this) 2) Action (tools solved this) 3) Trust (payment guardrails solve this). Sardis is #3."

7. "Every payment system asks: who do you trust? Sardis asks a better question: what rules do you want to enforce?"

8. "Multi-chain architecture because agents shouldn't care where liquidity lives. Sardis routes transactions across Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism based on cost + speed. You just write the policy."

9. "Real question: if your agent can execute transactions, and those transactions are auditable + policy-enforced, is it more trustworthy or less? I'd argue: more. Transparency builds trust."

10. "Week 1 insights from design partners: the top blocker for autonomous agents isn't reasoning or tooling. It's 'how do we let our agent move money without losing sleep?' That question has an answer now."

## ALL 20 REPLY TEMPLATES

### Technical Questions (5)

1. **MPC/Key Management**
"Great question. MPC via Turnkey splits the key across signers. Agent can't move funds alone; needs both Sardis (policy check) + user (veto). This way, [THREAT_MODEL] is mitigated. We wrote about the architecture here: sardis.sh/docs"

2. **On-Chain Auditability**
"Every transaction + policy check is auditable on-chain. You can verify policy compliance without trusting Sardis. Here's what the audit trail looks like: [EXAMPLE_TX]. Notice the full signature chain."

3. **Regulatory/Compliance**
"We integrated KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) from day 1. Not an afterthought. This way, enterprises can deploy agents with compliance rigor already baked in. DM if you want to talk through compliance architecture."

4. **Integration Complexity**
"Fair point. We've optimized for this: one API, integrates Turnkey (wallets) + Lithic (fiat) + Persona (KYC) + Elliptic (AML) under one SDK. You don't manage five integrations; we do. TypeScript + Python SDKs ready to go."

5. **Production Readiness**
"Right now: testnet only. We're being intentional about compliance + auditing before mainnet. If you're building agents, you can test Sardis on testnet today. Real money in [H3_2026]. DM to chat timeline."

### Competitive/Positioning (5)

6. **vs. Stripe**
"Stripe is great for payments. But they're not built for agents executing autonomously. They require human approval flows. Sardis compiles policies to smart contracts, so agents can execute within rules without human gate. Different problem, different solution."

7. **vs. Coinbase/x402**
"x402 is the standard we're building on top of. Not against. Coinbase is implementing x402 for their infrastructure. Sardis implements x402 + adds policy enforcement + non-custodial architecture. We're complementary."

8. **vs. Custodial Rails**
"Custodial is simpler, I agree. But it shifts key risk to a third party. Non-custodial + policy enforcement gets you both: user control + trustworthy guardrails. Enterprise buyers will realize this is the stronger position."

9. **Criticism: Too Complex**
"The architecture is complex; the API is simple. You write policies in English. SDKs handle MPC + on-chain logic. Integration is not harder than Stripe. Give it a shot on testnet?"

10. **Criticism: Another Crypto Payment Layer**
"We're not a crypto payment layer; we're a payment OS for agents. Happens to use blockchain for auditability, not ideology. If enterprises need agents with financial authority, they need infrastructure that's trustworthy + auditable. That's us."

### Sales/Engagement (10)

11. **Request for More Info**
"Happy to dig deeper. Are you building agents now, or thinking about it? If you're further along, let's do a quick call. If earlier stage, I'd send you testnet access + SDK docs. Either way, DM?"

12. **Founder/CEO Interested**
"This is exactly the problem we're solving. Would love to chat about [THEIR_USE_CASE]. You building agents for [THEIR_INDUSTRY]? DM me—let's see if Sardis is a fit."

13. **Engineer/Builder Interested**
"If you want to tinker, testnet is live now. SDK is TypeScript + Python. We've got docs + a design partner cohort shipping agents. DM and I'll get you set up in 15 min."

14. **VC/Investor Interested**
"Thanks for the interest. I'm raising a seed round—[RECENT_WINS / DESIGN_PARTNER_PROGRESS] showing early traction. Would love to chat. Are you focused on fintech infrastructure, or broader AI?"

15. **Skeptical/Critical**
"Fair point. You're right that [ACKNOWLEDGMENT]. Here's how we're thinking about it: [SARDIS_RESPONSE]. Would love your feedback—DM or I can send you testnet access to try it?"

16. **Someone Tags You**
"Thanks for the tag. [NAME], this is exactly what we're thinking about with Sardis. We're in testnet now with design partners. If you're exploring agent payments, would love to loop you in. DM?"

17. **Retweet Engagement**
"This resonates. One reason we built Sardis: [YOUR_AGREEMENT + ANGLE]. The missing piece for enterprise adoption is trustworthy financial infrastructure for autonomous agents."

18. **Direct Reply to Influential Account**
"[INSIGHTFUL_ADDITION]. This is why Sardis matters. Agents can't get enterprise adoption without [POLICY_ENFORCEMENT / NON-CUSTODIAL_INFRASTRUCTURE]. Curious what you think about the approach."

19. **Offer to Help**
"Are you working on this? We're shipping design partner program now. If you need a non-custodial payment layer for agents, I'd be happy to help. No sales pitch, just genuine offer. DM?"

20. **Build on Their Ideas**
"You said [QUOTE_THEIR_KEY_INSIGHT]. I'd add: [YOUR_VALUE-ADD]. This is why non-custodial + policy-enforced infrastructure is a game-changer. If you're exploring this space, Sardis might be worth a look."
