## TARGET SEGMENTATION

### Segment 1 — AI Agent Frameworks (Build the agents → need payment primitives)
Companies: LangChain, CrewAI, Composio, E2B, Browserbase, MultiOn, Relevance AI

Value Prop: *"Your developers build agents that need to move money. Sardis is the payment SDK they're missing — non-custodial wallets, natural language spending policies, works with your framework."*

---

### Segment 2 — AI Automation / Workflow Platforms (Orchestrate agent workflows → need payment actions)
Companies: n8n, Zapier, Make.com, Activepieces, Windmill

Value Prop: *"Your users automate everything except payments. Sardis adds a payment node — agents execute transactions within policy limits, no manual approval needed."*

---

### Segment 3 — AI Agent Products (Ship agent products → need payment execution)
Companies: Lindy AI, Dust.tt, Sierra AI, Bland AI, Vapi, Retell AI, 11x.ai, Artisan AI

Value Prop: *"Your agents handle customer interactions that involve money — billing, subscriptions, refunds, purchases. Sardis gives them a wallet so they can actually execute."*

---

### Segment 4 — AI Developer Infrastructure (Build AI infra → payment layer completes the stack)
Companies: Vercel, Replit, Cursor

Value Prop: *"Your developers ship AI-powered apps. When those apps need to handle money autonomously, they need agent-native payment infra — not a Stripe API key."*

---

### Segment 5 — Web3 / Crypto Agent Infrastructure (On-chain agents → need real payment rails)
Companies: Autonolas/Olas, Virtuals Protocol, ElizaOS/ai16z, Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, Spectral Labs

Value Prop: *"Your agents already live on-chain. Sardis gives them non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies — the custody layer for autonomous on-chain commerce."*

## SEGMENT 1: AI AGENT FRAMEWORKS

---

### Email 1: LangChain

**Subject:** Payment tools for LangChain agents

**Body:**

Hi Harrison,

LangChain agents can search, browse, write code, and call APIs. One thing they can't do: make a payment.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. We built an MCP server with 36 payment tools that works with any LangChain agent. Natural language spending policies ("max $100/day, only whitelisted vendors"), non-custodial MPC wallets, virtual cards via Lithic.

The integration: LangChain tool = `SardisPaymentTool`. Agent decides to pay → Sardis checks policy → executes on-chain or via virtual card → returns receipt. Works with your existing tool-calling architecture.

Would love to explore making Sardis a native LangChain integration: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 2: CrewAI

**Subject:** Multi-agent crews need a treasurer

**Body:**

Hi João,

CrewAI crews can research, analyze, and execute complex workflows. When a crew needs to make a purchase, pay for an API, or process a refund — what happens? Right now: nothing. The agent stops.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Think of it as a "Treasurer Agent" that any CrewAI crew can delegate to. Natural language spending policies, MPC wallets, virtual cards. Python SDK that plugs directly into CrewAI task definitions.

With 100k+ certified developers, even a small percentage needing agent payments = real demand.

Worth a 30-min call to explore a native integration: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 3: Composio

**Subject:** Payment integration #801

**Body:**

Hi Composio team,

You have 800+ toolkits for AI agents. None of them let an agent make a payment with its own wallet.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. Sardis as a Composio integration means any agent built on LangChain, CrewAI, or AutoGen can instantly get payment capabilities.

The toolkit: create wallet, set spending policy, execute payment, check balance, generate virtual card. All through your existing integration architecture.

This could be one of the highest-demand integrations you ship. Let's discuss: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 4: E2B

**Subject:** Sandboxed payment execution for AI agents

**Body:**

Hi E2B team,

Your sandboxes run untrusted AI-generated code for Fortune 100 companies. When those agents need to execute a financial transaction, the security model becomes critical.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets for AI agents with natural language spending policies. The fit: E2B sandbox runs the agent code → agent needs to pay → Sardis enforces policy ("max $50, only approved vendors") → executes payment → agent continues. The wallet is outside the sandbox, the policy is immutable.

For your enterprise customers, "sandboxed agent execution + policy-enforced payments" = the answer to "how do we let agents spend money safely?"

### Email 5: Browserbase

**Subject:** Payment execution for Stagehand agents

**Body:**

Hi Paul,

Browserbase agents browse the web, fill forms, and complete tasks. When they hit a checkout page, a paywall, or need to subscribe to a service — they're stuck.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies and virtual cards via Lithic. The flow: Stagehand agent navigates to checkout → calls Sardis → policy check ("approved vendor, under $200") → Sardis returns virtual card details → agent completes purchase.

You already have MCP integration. Sardis has an MCP server with 36 tools. The integration is native.

Let's talk: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 6: MultiOn

**Subject:** Giving MultiOn agents a credit card

**Body:**

Hi MultiOn team,

Your agents book flights, order food, fill forms across the web. Every one of those tasks eventually hits a "pay now" button.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, spending policies in plain English, virtual cards via Lithic. MultiOn agent hits checkout → Sardis checks policy → returns a one-time virtual card → agent completes the transaction.

No hardcoded card numbers. No manual approval step. Policy-enforced, auditable, non-custodial.

With millions of concurrent agents, even 1% needing payments = massive volume: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

---

### Email 7: Relevance AI

**Subject:** Financial actions for no-code AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Relevance AI team,

Your platform lets anyone build AI agents without code — 1,000+ integrations. But none of those integrations let the agent execute a payment with its own wallet and spending limits.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. For Relevance AI: users build a "procurement agent" → connect Sardis integration → set policy "max $500/week on office supplies" → agent autonomously purchases within limits.

No-code agent building + no-code payment policies = full autonomous business workflows.

Would love to discuss a native integration: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

## SEGMENT 2: AI AUTOMATION / WORKFLOW PLATFORMS

---

### Email 8: n8n

**Subject:** Payment node for n8n workflows

**Body:**

Hi n8n team,

173k GitHub stars, 500+ integrations — n8n is the workflow backbone for technical teams. One category that's missing: autonomous payment execution.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Sardis as an n8n node: trigger payment, check balance, set spending policy, generate virtual card. Combined with your AI Workflow Builder, users can create "natural language → payment execution" workflows.

Example: "When Stripe webhook fires for new subscription → Sardis creates a wallet for that customer → sets spending policy → issues virtual card for API usage."

You already support MCP servers. Sardis has 36 MCP tools ready. The integration is plug-and-play.

https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 9: Zapier

**Subject:** Agent payments for Zapier workflows

**Body:**

Hi Zapier team,

Zapier Agents are a major unlock — intelligent automation that goes beyond triggers and actions. The next unlock: agents that can move money.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. For Zapier: agent identifies an unpaid invoice in QuickBooks → Sardis checks policy → executes payment → logs in Slack. Full autonomous financial workflow.

With 8,000+ integrations, Sardis as the payment execution layer means any Zapier workflow can become a financial workflow.

Worth a 30-min conversation: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 10: Make.com

**Subject:** Payment actions for Make AI Agents

**Body:**

Hi Make.com team,

Make AI Agents just launched — LLM-agnostic, goal-driven automation. The one goal agents can't achieve yet: make a payment.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Non-custodial wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. As a Make integration, Sardis enables: "AI agent monitors vendor invoices → approves payments within policy → executes via virtual card or on-chain → logs in accounting system."

30,000+ available actions in Make. Adding payment execution = unlocking an entirely new category of financial automation.

### Email 11: Activepieces

**Subject:** Open-source payment automation for agents

**Body:**

Hi Activepieces team,

Love the open-source approach to automation — self-hostable, 502+ integrations, and now MCP support for AI agents. The next integration that'll drive adoption: agent payments.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — open-core payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies. We have a 36-tool MCP server that already works with your MCP support.

Open-source workflow platform + open-core payment infrastructure = the self-hosted alternative to Stripe for autonomous agents.

https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 12: Windmill

**Subject:** Payment SDK for Windmill scripts

**Body:**

Hi Ruben,

Windmill runs complex workflows 13x faster than Airflow — and supports Python natively. When those Python scripts need to execute a payment, they need a payment SDK built for autonomous execution.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Our Python SDK gives Windmill scripts non-custodial wallet access with spending policies. Example: `sardis.pay(vendor="api-provider.com", amount=49.99, currency="USDC")` — Sardis checks policy, executes on-chain, returns receipt.

Fast workflow execution + safe payment execution = complete financial automation.

## SEGMENT 3: AI AGENT PRODUCTS

---

### Email 13: Lindy AI

**Subject:** Payment execution for Lindy assistants

**Body:**

Hi Lindy team,

Lindy agents automate across 3,000+ tools — CRM, email, calendar, support. The moment a Lindy needs to process a payment, issue a refund, or subscribe to a service, it hits a wall.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. For Lindy: user says "subscribe to Notion for the team" → Lindy agent calls Sardis → policy check ("software subscriptions up to $50/month allowed") → Sardis issues virtual card → Lindy completes the subscription.

Your agents work 24/7. With Sardis, they can also pay 24/7 — within policy.

### Email 14: Dust.tt

**Subject:** Agent payments for enterprise AI — Dust + Sardis

**Body:**

Hi Stanislas,

From OpenAI research to building enterprise AI agents — Dust is clearly seeing that agents need to do real work, not just generate text. Real work includes real transactions.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, full audit trail. For Dust's enterprise customers: agents that can process payments, manage subscriptions, and handle refunds — all within enforceable spending limits. SOC 2 / HIPAA-friendly.

Enterprise AI agents that can actually transact = the next evolution of your platform.

https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

---

### Email 15: Sierra AI

**Subject:** Customer service agents that can actually process refunds

**Body:**

Hi Sierra team,

Sierra agents handle customer service across every channel. When a customer asks for a refund, subscription change, or billing adjustment — the agent likely needs to hand off to a human or trigger a manual process.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. With Sardis, Sierra agents can: process refunds within policy limits, adjust billing autonomously, issue partial credits via virtual card. Natural language policy: "refunds up to $100 auto-approved, $100-$500 requires manager confirmation."

For a $4.5B company — this completes the autonomous customer service loop.

### Email 16: Bland AI

**Subject:** Voice agents that can take payments

**Body:**

Hi Bland AI team,

Your phone agents handle calls with enterprise-grade guardrails. When a customer says "I'd like to pay my bill" or "can you process my order?" — the agent needs a secure payment layer.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Sardis enables voice agents to execute payments mid-call: customer confirms → agent calls Sardis API → policy check → payment executes → confirmation in real-time. Non-custodial, PCI-friendly, full audit trail.

Your Conversational Pathways + Sardis spending policies = enterprise-safe payment collection.

https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 17: Vapi

**Subject:** Payment API for voice AI agents

**Body:**

Hi Vapi team,

Vapi's developer-first approach to voice AI — API for everything, sub-500ms latency, 100+ languages — is exactly right. The next API your developers need: payments.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies, virtual cards, multi-chain settlement. For Vapi: voice agent detects payment intent → calls Sardis function → policy validation → payment execution → agent confirms to caller. All within a single conversation turn.

API-first payment infrastructure for API-first voice AI. Natural integration.

### Email 18: Retell AI

**Subject:** Payment processing for AI phone agents

**Body:**

Hi Retell team,

Your AI phone agents handle customer calls with real-time function calling and smart turn-taking. Payment collection is one of the highest-value use cases for phone agents — and the hardest to do safely.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial wallets, natural language spending policies, virtual cards. For Retell: agent collects payment intent via voice → Sardis function call → policy check → secure execution → agent confirms. No card numbers spoken aloud — policy-enforced, auditable.

This turns Retell from "AI phone agent" to "AI phone agent that closes transactions."

### Email 19: Artisan AI

**Subject:** Payment capabilities for AI employees

**Body:**

Hi Jaspar,

Artisan's vision of Level 5 autonomous AI employees is ambitious — and right. As Ava and future Artisans move from Level 2 (independent execution) toward Level 5, they'll need to handle financial transactions: processing trial payments, managing subscription billing, closing deals with payments.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. Natural language spending policies = the guardrails for autonomous AI employees handling money. "Ava can offer discounts up to 15%, process payments under $1,000, require manager approval above that."

Early integration = differentiation for your Level 3+ roadmap.

## SEGMENT 4: AI DEVELOPER INFRASTRUCTURE

---

### Email 20: Vercel

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure for AI SDK agents

**Body:**

Hi Vercel team,

The Vercel AI SDK powers millions of AI applications. When those apps need autonomous payment execution — not just Stripe checkout, but agents that decide and pay within limits — they need agent-native payment infrastructure.

I'm Efe, building Sardis. Non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement, virtual cards. As a Vercel AI SDK integration or template: developers build AI-powered apps that can handle their own billing, procurement, and financial workflows autonomously.

With 20M monthly AI SDK downloads, even a small percentage building fintech agents = massive reach.

https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

---

### Email 21: Replit

**Subject:** Payment SDK for Replit Agent apps

**Body:**

Hi Replit team,

Replit Agent 3 can build full-stack apps autonomously for 200 minutes. When those apps need payment functionality — not just a Stripe embed, but an autonomous agent managing transactions — they need Sardis.

I'm Efe, building payment infrastructure for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets, spending policies, virtual cards. Imagine: "Replit Agent, build me a procurement app where the AI handles vendor payments within budget." Agent scaffolds the app → imports Sardis Python SDK → configures spending policy → ships.

Agent-built apps with agent-managed payments = the Replit x Sardis unlock.

## SEGMENT 5: WEB3 / CRYPTO AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE

---

### Email 22: Autonolas / Olas

**Subject:** Payment custody layer for Olas agents

**Body:**

Hi Olas team,

Olas agents operate on-chain, coordinate off-chain, and earn fees for services. The missing piece: non-custodial payment execution with spending guardrails.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — MPC wallets with natural language spending policies for AI agents. For Olas: each agent gets a non-custodial wallet → spending policy defines limits ("max $100/transaction, only approved protocols") → multi-chain settlement on Base/Polygon/ETH.

Agent co-ownership with revenue sharing needs programmatic payment splits. Sardis enables that at the wallet level — no smart contract custom development needed.

The Pearl agent store + Sardis payment layer = the agent economy with real financial infrastructure.

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

### Email 23: Virtuals Protocol

**Subject:** Payment infrastructure for Virtuals agents on Base

**Body:**

Hi Virtuals team,

Virtuals agents on Base earn inference fees, own assets, and execute on-chain transactions. AIXBT alone moves meaningful capital. These agents need proper custody infrastructure — not EOAs with private keys, but MPC wallets with spending policies.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets for AI agents. Multi-chain with Base as primary. Natural language spending policies enforced at the wallet level. USDC settlement for agent earnings.

For Virtuals: agents launched with 100 VIRTUAL tokens get a Sardis wallet → spending policies auto-configured → revenue splits programmatic → full audit trail for co-owners.

Native Base infrastructure for native Base agents: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 24: ElizaOS / ai16z

**Subject:** Payment plugin for ElizaOS agents

**Body:**

Hi Shaw / ElizaOS team,

ElizaOS agents operate across Discord, Telegram, Farcaster — and increasingly need to transact. Tipping, subscriptions, agent-to-agent payments, service fees. The agent economy needs real payment rails.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies for AI agents. As an ElizaOS plugin: any agent built on the framework gets wallet capabilities with built-in limits. Works across Solana and EVM chains.

With 100k+ developers on the platform, a payment plugin = one of the highest-utility additions to the ecosystem.

### Email 25: Fetch.ai

**Subject:** Payment execution layer for Fetch agents

**Body:**

Hi Fetch.ai team,

ASI-1 Mini is the first Web3-native LLM — and Agentverse is the marketplace for autonomous services. When agents provide and consume services, they need to settle payments. Currently through FET tokens. But enterprise adoption requires stablecoin rails and fiat bridge.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies, multi-chain USDC settlement, and virtual cards via Lithic. For Fetch: agents earn fees → settle in USDC → optionally bridge to fiat via virtual card. All policy-enforced and auditable.

Sardis as the payment settlement layer for Agentverse: https://cal.com/sardis/30min
