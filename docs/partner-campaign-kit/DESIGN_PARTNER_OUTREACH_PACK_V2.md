## NEW TARGET SEGMENTATION

### Segment 6 — Agent-Native Finance Infrastructure (Building the financial layer for agents)
Companies: Catena Labs, Paid.ai, Prometeo, Campfire
Value Prop: *"You're building the financial plumbing for agents. Sardis is the non-custodial wallet + spending policy engine that plugs into your stack — MPC custody, natural language limits, multi-chain settlement."*

---

### Segment 7 — AI Accounting & AP Agents (Agents that process invoices, reconcile, and close books)
Companies: Nominal, Vic.ai, Hypatos, Open Ledger, Datarails
Value Prop: *"Your agents decide what gets paid and when. Sardis enforces how — spending policies, wallet custody, virtual cards — so agents can execute payments, not just approve them."*

---

### Segment 8 — Voice & CX AI Agents (Voice/chat agents handling customer financial interactions)
Companies: Decagon AI, Regal AI, PolyAI, Observe.AI, Gradient Labs
Value Prop: *"Your agents handle customer calls about billing, refunds, and payments. Sardis gives them a wallet so they can actually process the transaction — not just promise to 'escalate it'."*

---

### Segment 9 — AI Developer Tools & Agent OS (Building the IDE / OS / orchestration for agents)
Companies: /dev/agents, Bolt.new, Windsurf (Codeium), Simular, OpenRouter

## SEGMENT 6: AGENT-NATIVE FINANCE INFRA

---

### Email 1: Catena Labs

**Subject:** Non-custodial wallets for the agent economy

**Body:**

Hi Sean,

Congrats on the a16z crypto round and the Agent Commerce Kit launch — building the first regulated AI-native financial institution is exactly right.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets (Turnkey), natural language spending policies ("max $500/day, whitelisted vendors only"), multi-chain settlement (Base, Polygon, USDC), virtual cards via Lithic.

Our custody + policy engine could complement Catena's regulated account rails. Agent gets a Catena account + a Sardis wallet → full stack: regulation, custody, policy, execution.

Would love to explore the integration surface: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 2: Paid.ai

**Subject:** Agent wallets for results-based billing

**Body:**

Hi Manny,

Paid.ai solving billing for AI agents is the right wedge — the Outreach founder building the commercial layer for agents makes total sense.

I'm Efe, founder of Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. We handle the other side: agents get MPC wallets with spending policies, so they can actually execute payments, not just get billed. Natural language limits, multi-chain settlement, virtual cards.

The combo: Paid handles how agents get billed → Sardis handles how agents spend. Two sides of agent commerce.

### Email 3: Prometeo

**Subject:** Agent-to-agent payments need wallets

**Body:**

Hi Prometeo team,

Your A2A payment infrastructure for agent commerce is exactly the protocol layer the space needs — agents that can search, decide, and pay autonomously.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. We provide the wallet + policy enforcement layer: MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, multi-chain settlement. When an agent decides to pay via Prometeo, Sardis can be the custody layer that authorizes and executes.

Protocol-level integration between A2A routing (Prometeo) + spending policy enforcement (Sardis) could be powerful.

### Email 4: Campfire

**Subject:** Payment execution for AI accounting agents

**Body:**

Hi John,

The Large Accounting Model approach is fascinating — AI-native ERP that actually understands accounting, not just automates it. The Accel + Ribbit round validates the thesis.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. When Campfire's agents reconcile books and close cycles, they identify what needs to be paid. Sardis can be the execution layer: agent gets a non-custodial wallet with spending policies, executes the payment, returns the receipt for the books.

Accounting agent decides → Sardis enforces policy → payment executes → receipt back to Campfire. Clean loop.

## SEGMENT 7: AI ACCOUNTING & AP AGENTS

---

### Email 5: Nominal

**Subject:** Settlement layer for agentic accounting

**Body:**

Hi Nominal team,

AI agents that reconcile intercompany transactions across entities — that's a real pain point you're solving. The Next47-led round confirms it.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. When your agents detect a discrepancy or trigger a settlement, they need an execution layer. Sardis: non-custodial MPC wallets, natural language spending policies ("settle up to $10K/day between these entities"), virtual cards for vendor payments.

Your agents find what needs settling → Sardis executes it within policy → audit trail auto-generated.

### Email 6: Vic.ai

**Subject:** Your agents approve invoices — ours execute payments

**Body:**

Hi Vic.ai team,

500M+ invoices processed by AI is impressive. But after autonomous approval, the payment still requires manual execution, right?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. We close that last mile: agent approves invoice in Vic.ai → Sardis wallet checks spending policy → executes payment via virtual card or on-chain → receipt loops back. Fully autonomous invoice-to-payment.

Natural language policies: "pay approved invoices under $5K automatically, flag above $5K for human review."

### Email 7: Hypatos

**Subject:** From invoice extraction to payment execution

**Body:**

Hi Hypatos team,

Your AI agents extract, match, and approve invoices — Gartner recognition for AP automation is well-deserved. But what happens after approval?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. The missing step: Hypatos agent approves → Sardis wallet enforces spending policy → payment executes automatically. MPC wallets, natural language limits, virtual cards via Lithic, full audit trail.

One integration turns Hypatos from "AP intelligence" to "AP intelligence + execution."

### Email 8: Open Ledger

**Subject:** Payment rails for embedded accounting agents

**Body:**

Hi Open Ledger team,

Embedded accounting API with AI payroll forecasting and expense agents — that's the right architecture. SaaS companies need this natively.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. When your agents predict labor costs and manage expenses, they eventually need to execute payments. Sardis provides the wallet infrastructure: MPC custody, natural language spending policies, virtual cards for vendor payments.

Your API handles the intelligence → Sardis handles the execution. Clean separation, one integration.

### Email 9: Datarails

**Subject:** From financial forecasting to financial execution

**Body:**

Hi Datarails team,

AI-powered FP&A connecting to 200+ accounting systems is powerful. When your agents identify spending anomalies or forecast budget needs, the next step is action.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Sardis can be the execution layer: agent detects over-budget category → auto-adjusts spending policies on the wallet → blocks or approves future transactions. Natural language policies, MPC wallets, full audit trail.

From "your Q3 marketing spend is 12% over budget" to automatically enforcing the correction.

## SEGMENT 8: VOICE & CX AI AGENTS

---

### Email 10: Decagon AI

**Subject:** Let your CX agents process payments, not just talk about them

**Body:**

Hi Decagon team,

$4.5B valuation for AI concierge across voice, chat, email, SMS — clearly the market agrees customer service is going agentic.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Right now your agents handle "I want a refund" by escalating. With Sardis: agent verifies request → checks refund policy (natural language) → executes refund from MPC wallet → confirms to customer. Real resolution, not routing.

Virtual cards, spending policies, full audit trail. One SDK integration.

### Email 11: Regal AI

**Subject:** Your voice agents collect payments — let them execute too

**Body:**

Hi Alex,

Real-time voice AI agents for contact centers handling inbound/outbound calls — and $40M to scale it. When those agents handle billing calls, what happens at "I'd like to pay my balance"?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Sardis gives voice agents a wallet: process payment collection during the call, enforce spending/refund policies via natural language rules, return confirmation in real-time. MPC custody, virtual cards, audit trail.

Voice agent collects → Sardis executes → customer confirmed. No human handoff.

Worth a 30-min call? https://cal.com/sardis/30min

Efe Baran Durmaz
Founder, Sardis — sardis.sh

---

### Email 12: PolyAI

**Subject:** Multi-language voice agents + payment execution

**Body:**

Hi PolyAI team,

Voice AI agents handling customer service across multiple languages — when a French customer calls about a refund or a German customer wants to pay an invoice, the agent needs to do more than understand the request.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Sardis gives your agents a wallet with natural language spending policies: "process refunds under €200 automatically, route above to manager." MPC custody, virtual cards, multi-currency settlement.

Your agents understand → Sardis executes. One SDK.

### Email 13: Observe.AI

**Subject:** From conversation intelligence to payment action

**Body:**

Hi Swapnil,

Observe.AI's conversation intelligence for contact centers gives you the full picture of what's happening in customer calls. A natural next step: when the AI identifies a payment-related intent, it can act.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Integration concept: Observe.AI detects "refund request" or "payment due" intent → triggers Sardis wallet action → agent processes the payment within policy limits → outcome logged back to Observe.AI for analytics.

Intelligence + execution = complete agentic customer service.

### Email 14: Gradient Labs

**Subject:** Payment execution for regulated financial agents

**Body:**

Hi Dimitri,

AI agents for customer operations in regulated financial services — the ex-Monzo team building this makes perfect sense. You understand what compliance-first agent design means.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. We're built for exactly this: KYC via Persona, AML via Elliptic, programmable spending policies, MPC wallets, full audit trail. Your agents make the decision → Sardis enforces the regulatory guardrails + executes.

Would love to compare notes on compliant agent payments: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

## SEGMENT 9: AI DEVELOPER TOOLS & AGENT OS

---

### Email 15: /dev/agents

**Subject:** Payment primitives for the agent OS

**Body:**

Hi David,

An operating system for AI agents — with Hugo Barra, Ficus Kirkpatrick, and Nicholas Jitkoff, this is the right team. Every OS needs system-level primitives, and one of the most important: money.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets, natural language spending policies, virtual cards, multi-chain settlement. Think of it as the payment syscall for /dev/agents: agent requests payment → OS checks policy → Sardis executes → receipt returned.

Would love to explore making Sardis a native /dev/agents primitive: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 16: Bolt.new (StackBlitz)

**Subject:** Payment SDK for AI-generated apps

**Body:**

Hi Eric,

Bolt.new generating full-stack apps from text is magic. But when those AI-generated apps need to handle payments — subscriptions, checkout, billing — the agent currently can't generate that.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Sardis SDK = one import for agent-native payments. Imagine: user says "build me an e-commerce app" → Bolt generates it with Sardis payments baked in. Non-custodial wallets, spending policies, virtual cards.

Payments as a native Bolt.new capability.

### Email 17: Windsurf (Codeium)

**Subject:** Payment integration for Cascade agents

**Body:**

Hi Windsurf team,

Cascade as an agentic coding assistant is impressive — AI that understands the full codebase context and writes across files. When developers ask Cascade to build payment flows, what SDK does it reach for?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Python + TypeScript SDKs, MCP server with 36 tools. If Cascade knows Sardis, it can generate agent-native payment code: wallet creation, spending policies, transaction execution. Not Stripe callbacks — actual autonomous agent payments.

Worth a conversation about making Sardis a Cascade-native SDK: https://cal.com/sardis/30min

### Email 18: Simular

**Subject:** Desktop agents need wallets

**Body:**

Hi Ang,

AI agents controlling Mac and Windows desktops with neuro-symbolic reasoning — that's powerful. When those agents need to make a purchase, pay a subscription, or process an expense on behalf of the user, they need a financial identity.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets give desktop agents a non-custodial financial identity with natural language spending limits. "Can browse and buy office supplies up to $200/month, only from approved vendors."

Desktop agent + wallet = truly autonomous assistant.

### Email 19: OpenRouter

**Subject:** Payment routing for LLM gateway agents

**Body:**

Hi OpenRouter team,

500+ models routed through a unified gateway — essential infrastructure. When agents route between models, they incur costs. Right now that's billed to the developer. But what if the agent managed its own API budget?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Agent gets a wallet with policy: "max $50/day on API calls, prefer cheapest model above quality threshold." Sardis + OpenRouter = agents that autonomously manage their own inference spend.

Interesting concept? https://cal.com/sardis/30min

## SEGMENT 10: DeFi & TRADING AGENT PLATFORMS

---

### Email 20: SingularityDAO

**Subject:** MPC wallets for autonomous DeFi agents

**Body:**

Hi SingularityDAO team,

AI agents managing DynaSets — dynamic asset portfolios with autonomous rebalancing — is exactly where DeFi meets the agent economy. The ASI Alliance merger makes the vision even bigger.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets with programmable spending policies for your DeFi agents: "max $10K/trade, only whitelisted DEXs, rebalance within 5% of target allocation." Multi-chain (Base, Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism).

Policy-enforced custody for autonomous DeFi agents.

### Email 21: Numerai

**Subject:** Agent wallets for crowd-sourced trading

**Body:**

Hi Richard,

Numerai's AI-run hedge fund model — crowd-sourced models staking NMR tokens — is brilliant. 25%+ net return in 2024 proves it works. As models become more autonomous, they'll need their own financial identity.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Non-custodial MPC wallets with spending policies. Imagine: each model agent gets its own Sardis wallet, stakes autonomously within policy limits, manages rewards. Agent-native custody for the Numerai ecosystem.

### Email 22: Jenova AI

**Subject:** Custody layer for institutional trading agents

**Body:**

Hi Jenova team,

Institutional-grade AI agents for crypto, forex, and derivatives — real-time analysis with autonomous execution. The custody question is critical: who holds the keys when an agent trades?

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets (Turnkey) mean neither you nor the agent fully controls the keys. Natural language trading policies: "max $50K/day, only ETH/USDC pairs, stop-loss at 5%." Multi-chain, full audit trail.

Non-custodial + policy-enforced = institutional-grade agent custody.

### Email 23: Fiddler AI

**Subject:** Spending guardrails for autonomous agents

**Body:**

Hi Fiddler team,

AI guardrails and governance at the model level — critical infrastructure. But there's a gap: even with model guardrails, agents need financial guardrails too.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. Think of us as the financial guardrail layer: natural language spending policies ("max $1K/day, whitelisted vendors, no crypto withdrawals"), MPC custody so no single party holds keys, full audit trail.

Fiddler guards what agents say → Sardis guards what agents spend. Complementary control planes.

### Email 24: Payhawk

**Subject:** Agent wallet layer for enterprise finance

**Body:**

Hi Payhawk team,

Four enterprise AI agents — Financial Controller, Procurement, Travel, Payments — that's the right product architecture. When those agents autonomously manage spend, they need a custody + policy layer.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets with natural language spending policies. Your Procurement agent gets a Sardis wallet: "max $25K/PO, only approved vendor list, require 2-of-3 approval above $10K." Non-custodial, full audit trail.

Enterprise agent finance = Payhawk intelligence + Sardis execution.

### Email 25: Ramp

**Subject:** Agent-native spend management

**Body:**

Hi Ramp team,

$32B valuation building the future of spend management — with AI agents for AP, expenses, travel, procurement. As those agents move from "suggest" to "execute," they'll need their own financial identity.

I'm Efe, building Sardis — non-custodial payment OS for AI agents. MPC wallets + natural language spending policies + virtual cards. Ramp's agents get Sardis wallets: auto-execute approved expenses, enforce travel budgets in real-time, process AP within policy limits.

From "here's a recommendation" to "it's done, here's the receipt."
