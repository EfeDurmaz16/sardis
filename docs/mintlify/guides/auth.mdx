# Authentication

Sardis API currently uses API keys for service-to-service access. In production, scope keys and enable request signing between internal services.

## API Keys
- Provide `x-api-key` header on requests.
- Create separate keys per environment (dev/sandbox/prod).
- Scope keys to least privilege (read | write | admin).

## Internal Service Signing
For production hardening, sign internal requests:
- Compute HMAC over body + timestamp; include `x-signature` and `x-timestamp` headers.
- Reject requests older than 5 minutes.

## Rate Limits
- Per-agent mandate verification is rate limited (configurable in `sardis_protocol.rate_limiter`).
- Configure limits via environment or pass `RateLimitConfig` to `MandateVerifier`.

## Recommended Headers
- `x-api-key`: required for external callers
- `x-request-id`: traceability
- `x-client`: client identifier

## Examples
```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $SARDIS_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/v2/cards
```
