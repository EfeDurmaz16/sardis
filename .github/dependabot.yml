# Security-focused settings
# Dependabot will automatically:
# - Create PRs for security updates immediately (not just weekly)
# - Prioritize security updates over regular updates
# - Group minor/patch updates to reduce PR noise
# - Auto-merge patch updates (if auto-merge is enabled in repo settings)
