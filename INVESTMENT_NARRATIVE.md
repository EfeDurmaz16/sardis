# Sardis Payment OS - Investment Narrative

## Executive Summary

**Sardis** is the first **Payment Operating System for AI Agents** - enabling autonomous software agents to manage money safely while humans maintain control.

### The Opportunity

The AI agent market is projected to reach $65B by 2028. Every AI agent that needs to transact - from e-commerce bots to autonomous trading systems - requires a secure, compliant payment infrastructure. Sardis is that infrastructure.

---

## The Problem

### AI Agents Can't Safely Handle Money Today

1. **No Spending Controls**: Current payment systems weren't designed for autonomous agents. When an agent has access to a payment method, it has full access.

2. **No Compliance Framework**: Agents transacting globally face KYC/AML requirements with no standard solution.

3. **No Multi-Chain Support**: Agents operating across blockchain ecosystems need unified payment rails.

4. **No Human Oversight**: Business owners can't set guardrails or approve high-value transactions.

### Market Pain Points

- **E-commerce Agents**: Can't set per-transaction limits or vendor restrictions
- **Trading Bots**: No compliance layer for cross-border settlements
- **Corporate AI**: No approval workflows for budget-controlled spending
- **Developer Teams**: Building custom payment infrastructure from scratch

---

## The Solution: Sardis Payment OS

### Natural Language Policy Engine

```
"Allow payments up to $500 to approved vendors.
 Require approval for amounts over $1000.
 Block gambling and adult content."
```

Sardis converts plain English policies into enforced spending rules. Business owners define guardrails; agents operate within them.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Policy Engine** | Natural language → enforced rules |
| **Multi-Chain Support** | 5 EVM chains + stablecoins |
| **Virtual Cards** | Per-agent cards with custom limits |
| **Fiat Rails** | Bank ↔ crypto via Bridge.xyz |
| **MPC Wallets** | Enterprise-grade key security |
| **Compliance** | Built-in KYC (Persona) + AML (Elliptic) |
| **MCP Integration** | 36 tools for Claude/GPT agents |
